## üîß Emergency Response Plan

### If Systems Go Down

```bash
# 1. Check if dev server crashed
lsof -i:3000

# 2. Check logs for errors
tail -100 /tmp/maia-dev-server.log

# 3. Restart with launch script
./start.sh

# 4. Run diagnostics
npm run test:beta

# 5. Test endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/maya-chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Test","userId":"emergency"}'
```

### If Claude API Returns 529 (Overloaded)

‚úÖ **Already handled** by retry logic in `PersonalOracleAgent.ts:221-264`
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s
- Max 3 attempts
- Graceful fallback message

3. Queue requests if needed

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/maya-chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Test voice","userId":"test","enableVoice":true}'
```

**Fallback:**
- Disable voice temporarily in app

# Check Supabase connection
# [Add your Supabase health check command]

## üôè Sacred Pauses Throughout the Day

Remember to pause at:
- **10:00 AM** - Before email send (5 breaths)
- **11:00 AM** - Walk outside (10 minutes)
- **1:00 PM** - Mindful lunch (30 minutes)
- **3:00 PM** - Brief meditation (5 minutes)
- **5:00 PM** - Evening reflection (15 minutes)

**Why these pauses matter:**

You're not launching a product.
You're opening a space for emergence.

The quality of your presence matters.
The spiral needs both action and stillness.

If you're anxious, users will feel it.
If you're grounded, they'll trust the space.
