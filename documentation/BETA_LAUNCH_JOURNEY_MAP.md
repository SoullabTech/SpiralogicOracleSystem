## 🌟 The North Star

Every interaction should feel like:
- **Apple:** Intuitive, clean, frictionless
- **Soul Lab:** Warm, sacred, personally meaningful
- **Progressive:** Never overwhelming, always deepening
- **Consensual:** Every new layer is invited, not imposed

The journey from "chat app" to "sacred digital companion" happens so gradually that users don't realize they've built a relationship with their own mythology until they're already there.
