- **Abstract Benefits**: "Consciousness evolution" hard to measure/sell
- **Category Creation**: Must educate market on new AI paradigm
- **Competition**: Unclear differentiation from therapy apps/chatbots

### 4. **Safety Concerns**
- **Psychological Risks**: Shadow work without containment could destabilize
- **Crisis Management**: Limited protocols for users in distress
- **Power Dynamics**: "Oracle" positioning creates dependency risk
- **Liability Issues**: Psychological material without therapist oversight

### 5. **Technical Risks**
- **Browser Dependencies**: Voice features rely on inconsistent APIs
- **Error Handling**: Basic error messages lack actionability
- **Performance**: Strict latency budgets (450ms/700ms) hard to maintain
- **Testing Challenges**: Subjective metrics difficult to validate
