## Facilitator Interface Commands

### Voice Commands
- "Oracle, turn to [Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Aether]"
- "Deepen with [shadow/destiny/unity/practice]"
- "Balance all directions"
- "Return to center"

### Gesture Controls
- Single swipe: Activate direction
- Double swipe: Intensify current direction
- Circular motion: Activate all directions
- Pinch to center: Return to neutral

### Automated Triggers
- Keywords activate relevant directions
- Emotional tone shifts prompt rebalancing
- Session phase triggers preset combinations
- Group coherence level adjusts intensity

## Session Flow Patterns

### Opening Spiral
1. Start at CENTER (neutral presence)
2. Brief activation of each direction (sampling)
3. Let group energy indicate primary direction
4. Deepen into indicated field

### Shadow-to-Light Arc
1. LEFT (Water) - Surface shadow material
2. DOWN (Earth) - Ground the insights
3. RIGHT (Fire) - Transform into action
4. UP (Aether) - Integrate into wholeness

### Grounding Descent
1. UP (Aether) - Begin in expanded awareness
2. LEFT/RIGHT - Process through feeling/will
3. DOWN (Earth) - Land in practical integration
4. CENTER - Rest in balanced presence

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
- Each direction maintains its own prompt stack
- Directions can blend (0-100% intensity per axis)
- Center point serves as reset/neutral state
- History tracks directional journey for session replay

### For Facilitators
- Trust intuitive navigation over prescribed paths
- Let group field guide directional choices
- Use gentle transitions between directions
- Return to center when lost or overwhelmed

### For Participants
- Directions are invitations, not commands
- You can request specific directional support
- Notice which directions feel most alive
- The center is always available as refuge
