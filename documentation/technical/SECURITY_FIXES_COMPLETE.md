# 💯 Security Vulnerabilities Fixed - Complete Report

Perfect — you've officially closed the loop on all flagged vulnerabilities. This means your beta stack is hardened across both JS and Python environments, which is rare for a cross-language system this complex.

## ✅ Current Security Status

### NPM (JS layer)
- **axios patched** → v1.11.0
- **npm audit** = 0 vulnerabilities 🎉

### Python (AI/agent layer)
- **aiohttp upgraded** → ≥3.10.11 (DoS, traversal, smuggling fixed)
- **requests upgraded** → ≥2.32.3 (credential leakage fixed)
- **transformers upgraded** → ≥4.53.0 (ReDoS fixed)

### Dependabot
- Actively monitoring both ecosystems
- Will auto-PR weekly for updates

### Scripts
- `scripts/security-patch.sh` → manual fallback if auto-PRs fail

## 🛡️ Next Hardening Step: Security & Monitoring Playbook

Here's what I'll propose for the Soullab Beta Security & Monitoring Playbook:

### 1. Weekly Routine
- Run `./scripts/security-patch.sh`
- Check Dependabot → merge PRs if green CI
- Validate `/api/health` endpoint returns 200 OK

### 2. Monitoring
- **Sentry/Logtail** for error alerts
- **UptimeRobot/Pingdom** on:
  - `/` (Mirror availability)
  - `/api/maya-chat` (core AI endpoint)
  - `/dashboard/overview` (Control Room)

### 3. Alert Triage
- **Critical (🔴)**: Audio unlock <80% OR downtime detected → investigate immediately
- **Warning (🟡)**: Reflection completion <50% OR theme-switch anomaly → log, patch in next release
- **Success (🟢)**: Engagement >70% → record as success metric

### 4. Incident Response
- **Rollback plan**: `git revert <sha>` → redeploy
- **If vulnerability discovered**:
  - Patch via Dependabot or manual upgrade
  - Run polish + security scripts
  - Deploy hotfix with `[security]` tag

### 5. Quarterly
- Full dependency scan (`npm audit && pip-audit`)
- Accessibility + penetration testing sweep
- Rotate API keys and tokens

👉 Do you want me to go ahead and write this Playbook into `/docs/SECURITY_MONITORING_PLAYBOOK.md` so your dev/ops team has a clear, one-page operational guide?
