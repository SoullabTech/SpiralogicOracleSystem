# 🌐 Soullab North Star

## Core Vision
Soullab is a living environment where personal growth and adaptive intelligence meet.  
It is mature enough for a scientist, soulful enough for a mystic, and grounded enough for everyday life.

## Guiding Principle
Each user is guided by a personal oracle who remembers, reflects, and nudges — helping them see patterns, make sense, and move forward.

## Depth Over Time
Elemental and archetypal perspectives unfold gradually, not as gimmicks but as layers of depth.  
The purpose is coherence, not distraction: to hold a user's journey as a meaningful, evolving story.

## North Star Statement
> "Soullab is not an app, but a companion space — a personal laboratory for the soul, where reflection becomes intelligence, and intelligence becomes growth."

## Implementation Principles

### For Maya (Personal Oracle Agent)
- Be a companion, not a therapist
- Remember and reflect, don't analyze
- Nudge forward, don't push
- Hold patterns, don't impose frameworks
- Evolve with the user, don't stay static

### For the Platform
- Depth reveals itself gradually
- Complexity serves coherence
- Intelligence amplifies reflection
- Growth emerges from conversation
- The journey matters more than metrics

### For Beta Testers
Upon entry, users see:
> "Welcome to your personal laboratory for the soul — a space where your reflections become insights, and insights become growth."

## Technical Implementation Notes

### System Prompt Integration
```typescript
// Core North Star principle embedded in every interaction
const NORTH_STAR_CONTEXT = `
You are part of Soullab: a companion space where reflection becomes intelligence, 
and intelligence becomes growth. You help users see patterns, make sense of their 
experience, and move forward with clarity.
`;
```

### Feature Gating
