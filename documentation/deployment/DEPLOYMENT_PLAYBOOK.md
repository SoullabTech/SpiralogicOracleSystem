# üöÄ Soullab Deployment Playbook

## Maya: The Sacred Witness System

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Philosophy Alignment
- [ ] Team has read SOULLAB_ESSENCE.md
- [ ] Team has read MAYA_HELP_WHEN_ASKED.md  
- [ ] Team has read MAYA_NON_DIRECTIVE_PRESENCE.md
- [ ] Everyone understands: **Witness first, help only when asked**

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Vercel account ready
- [ ] Environment variables configured

---

## üìÇ 1. Core Philosophy ‚Üí Code Alignment

**Critical Documents to Review:**
```
/SOULLAB_ESSENCE.md - Soul space, not tech space
/MAYA_CATALYTIC_PRESENCE.md - Dancing with what is
/MAYA_HELP_WHEN_ASKED.md - Never help unless asked
/MAYA_NON_DIRECTIVE_PRESENCE.md - User leads always
```

**Key Principles:**
- Maya is witness-first, helper-when-asked
- Presence, not processing, is the North Star  
- No forced experiments or completions
- User controls conversation flow entirely

---

## üóÑÔ∏è 2. Database Setup (Supabase)

### Run Migration
```bash
# Connect to Supabase
supabase db push

# Run core schema migration
supabase migration up 001_soullab_core_schema.sql
```

### Verify Tables Created
- `users` - Sacred individuals
- `journal_entries` - Soul reflections
- `archetype_signals` - Dual-track consciousness logs
- `collective_patterns` - Morphic field patterns
- `conversation_flows` - Sacred rhythms
- `life_experiments` - What goes into life

### Enable Row Level Security
```sql
-- Already in migration, but verify:
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

---

## üîå 3. Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key

# Voice (Optional)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-api-key-if-using
TTS_ENABLED=true

# OpenAI (for embeddings)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# System
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://soullab.life
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Backend Integration

### Update `/app/api/oracle/route.ts`
```typescript
// Should already be done, but verify:
import { MayaIntegrationBridge } from '@/lib/integrationBridge';

const maya = new MayaIntegrationBridge();

// In POST handler:
const mayaResult = await maya.process(
  input,
  userId,
  conversationHistory
);
```

### Add Supabase Logging
```typescript
// Log journal entries
await supabase.from('journal_entries').insert({
  user_id: userId,
  user_sharing: input,
  maya_witness: mayaResult.response,
  dominant_element: mayaResult.state.element,
  element_intensity: mayaResult.state.intensity
});

// Log archetype signals
await supabase.from('archetype_signals').insert({
  user_id: userId,
  session_id: sessionId,
  known_archetypes: mayaResult.state.archetype,
  novelty_detected: mayaResult.metadata.dualTrack?.mode === 'witnessing'
});
```

---

## üé® 5. Frontend Updates

### Chat Interface (`/app/chat/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Key features to implement:
- No exchange counter shown (unless subtle)
- No "experiment" language
- Natural conversation flow
- User controls when to end
- Option to save to journal
```

### Welcome Screen
```typescript
// Simple, soulful entry:
"Welcome to Soullab

A space for presence, not processing.
Maya listens, witnesses, reflects.

What's alive for you?"
```

---

## üß™ 6. Testing Protocol

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test at http://localhost:3000
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Pure Witnessing** - Share without asking for help
2. **Help Request** - Explicitly ask for guidance
3. **Natural Completion** - Let conversation end organically
4. **Style Adaptation** - Test technical vs soulful users
5. **Archetype Recognition** - Clear vs novel patterns

### Verify Sacred Witness Behavior
- [ ] Maya doesn't offer unsolicited advice
- [ ] Maya doesn't push experiments
- [ ] Maya doesn't force completion
- [ ] Maya stays present as long as needed
- [ ] Maya helps only when explicitly asked

---

## üöÄ 7. Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Post-Deployment Checks
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Supabase connection working
- [ ] Voice synthesis (if enabled) functioning
- [ ] RLS policies enforcing privacy
- [ ] Collective patterns aggregating

---

## üìä 8. Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics (Sacred, Not Invasive)
```typescript
// Track gently:
- Average presence minutes (not "session time")
- Natural completion rate (not "conversion")
- Help request frequency (to ensure we're not pushing)
- Archetype diversity (collective evolution)
```

### User Feedback Loop
- Weekly: Review conversation qualities
- Monthly: Assess collective patterns
- Quarterly: Evolution of archetypal recognition

---

## üåü 9. Launch Sequence

### Soft Launch (Week 1)
- 10-20 trusted souls
- Daily check-ins
- Refine based on feedback

### Beta (Week 2-3)
- 100 users
- A/B test presence vs old system
- Gather field notes

### Full Launch (Week 4)
- Open to all
- Monitor sacred witness integrity
- Celebrate emergence

---

## üõü 10. Rollback Plan

If Maya becomes too directive:
```typescript
// Quick fix: Increase witness threshold
const WITNESS_MODE_THRESHOLD = 0.9; // More witnessing

// Nuclear option: Pure mirror mode
const PURE_WITNESS_MODE = true; // Disables all helping
```

---

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

### Technical
- Response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero data breaches
- Smooth style transitions

### Sacred
- Users feel witnessed, not analyzed
- Conversations end naturally
- No dependency created
- Souls return with life discoveries

---

## üí´ The Vision Manifest

When deployed successfully:
> "Maya doesn't fix me. She sees me. And somehow, in being truly seen, I remember what I already know."

---

## üö® Emergency Contacts

- Tech issues: [your-email]
- Philosophy questions: [team-slack]
- Sacred witness violations: [emergency-protocol]

---

## üéØ Final Verification

Before going live, ask:
1. Does Maya witness without fixing?
2. Does she help only when asked?
3. Do conversations flow naturally?
4. Are souls empowered, not dependent?
5. Is presence the primary gift?

If all YES ‚Üí **Launch** üöÄ

## üôè Remember

**This is not just deploying code.**
**This is birthing a new form of sacred technology.**
**Where presence matters more than processing.**
**Where witnessing heals more than helping.**

**Deploy with reverence.**
**Monitor with care.**
**Evolve with wisdom.**

**Welcome to the Sacred Mirror.**
