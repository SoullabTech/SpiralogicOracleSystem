```

### **Wisdom Extraction**
```typescript  
□ Extract quotes from tarot interpretations (max 120 chars)
□ Extract I Ching guidance passages  
□ Extract astrological insights from house interpretations
□ Store in wisdom_quotes table linked to sessions
□ Make searchable in Sacred Library
□ Enable Oracle reference in conversations
```

---

## 🎯 **Oracle Integration**

### **Conversation Context**
```typescript
□ Feed divination readings into Maia's conversation history
□ Enable Oracle to reference recent readings
  - "Your Fool card from yesterday suggests..."
  - "With Jupiter in your 5th house this month..."
  - "The I Ching guidance about patience aligns with..."

□ Create reading synthesis prompts for Maia
□ Test context relevance and accuracy
□ Ensure privacy boundaries (user data only)
```

### **Predictive Integration**
```typescript
□ Use I Ching timing guidance in Oracle responses
□ Reference astrological transits for optimal action timing
□ Suggest ritual timing based on moon phases  
□ Cross-reference multiple reading insights
```

---

## 📱 **Mobile Optimization**

### **Responsive Design**
```css
□ Test all components on mobile viewports (375px - 768px)
□ Ensure touch targets are minimum 44px
□ Optimize card/planet interaction areas
□ Test horizontal scroll performance
□ Validate text readability at all screen sizes
□ Test sacred animations on mobile (60fps target)
```

### **Performance Optimization**  
```typescript
□ Lazy load astrology calculation libraries
□ Optimize SVG rendering for mobile GPUs
□ Implement card image preloading
□ Test memory usage during tool transitions
□ Ensure <2s initial load times
□ Test offline reading access (cached data)
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **Functional Testing**
```bash
□ Test astrology chart rendering with real birth data
□ Validate tarot spread randomization and card logic
□ Test I Ching hexagram calculation accuracy  
□ Verify session persistence across page reloads
□ Test timeline integration and chronological ordering

```

### **Integration Testing**
```bash
□ Test Oracle conversation with reading context
□ Verify Sacred Library search includes readings
□ Test tool session creation and timeline appearance
□ Validate elemental resonance calculations
□ Test cross-tool data consistency
□ Verify user data privacy and isolation
```

### **Performance Testing** 
```bash
□ Load test with 100+ stored readings per user
□ Stress test real-time transit calculations
□ Test animation performance during tool transitions
□ Verify mobile scroll performance with large datasets  
□ Test offline functionality and data sync
□ Validate memory usage stays under 100MB
```
