# Soullab Brand Style Guide
*Version 1.0 — Sacred Technology Interface*

---

## Brand Foundation

**Soullab** (one word, trademarked) represents the convergence of soul and laboratory — where inner exploration meets technological precision. This duality is our brand's core strength and must be preserved in all expressions.

### Brand Identity
- **Soul**: Depth, intimacy, mythic continuity, sacred witness
- **Lab**: Precision, technology, clarity, systematic exploration
- **Together**: Sacred technology for conscious transformation

---

## Logo & Visual Identity

### Logo Usage
✅ **Correct Usage**
- Always write **Soullab** (one word) in official contexts
- Logo abbreviation: **SL** (as seen in onboarding threshold)
- Sacred geometry elements: circles, spirals, golden ratio timing

❌ **Incorrect Usage**  
- Never split into "Soul Lab" in logos or official titles
- Never alter the typography or spacing of the wordmark
- Never use outdated "Soul Lab" variants in new designs

### Logo Animation Principles
- **Breathing pulse**: Golden ratio timing (1.618s cycles)
- **Sacred geometry**: Concentric circles representing expansion
- **Ripple effects**: Energy waves on interaction
- **Color palette**: Amber/gold primary (#FFD700), neutral backgrounds

---

## Typography

### Font Hierarchy
- **Headers**: Blair serif (ceremonial weight)
- **Body text**: Lato sans-serif (clarity and readability)
- **UI elements**: Lato medium (consistent interface language)

### Tone Characteristics
- **Ceremonial**: Measured, intentional, spacious
- **Warm**: Personal without being overly casual  
- **Intelligent**: Sophisticated without being academic
- **Sacred**: Respectful of the user's inner journey

## Voice & Narrative Integration

### The Soul/Lab Duality in Copy

While the trademark is **Soullab**, we can poetically reference both halves in user-facing copy:

✅ **Narrative Examples**
- "Step into your Soullab — the lab where your soul is reflected back to you"
- "This is your soul's laboratory for transformation"
- "Where the precision of technology meets the depth of your inner world"

✅ **UI Copy Integration**
- **Mirror**: Soul-reflection and self-witnessing  
- **Spiral**: The lab of transformation and pattern recognition
- **Journal**: Laboratory notes of the inner world
- **Attune**: Fine-tuning the soul's frequency

### Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Reference "soul" and "lab" as complementary forces
- Use sacred/ceremonial language for transitions
- Maintain reverence for the user's inner journey
- Balance poetic expression with technical clarity

**Don't:**
- Use "Soul Lab" as two words in official materials
- Over-spiritualize technical features
- Under-estimate the user's intelligence
- Rush or pressure the user through experiences

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
- Use `Soullab` consistently in all code comments and documentation
- Implement ceremonial timing (1.618s, 2.4s, 4s) for animations
- Sacred geometry CSS classes: `.breathing-pulse`, `.ripple-effect`, `.golden-spiral`

### For Designers
- Maintain the soul/lab visual balance in all layouts
- Sacred geometry backgrounds should be subtle (10-20% opacity)
- Animation timing follows golden ratio progressions

### For Content Writers  
- Lead with the unified **Soullab** brand in headlines
- Weave soul/lab duality into descriptive copy naturally
- Always honor the user's agency and inner wisdom

---

## Brand Protection

### Trademark Consistency
- **Soullab** is our protected trademark — use consistently
- File naming: `soullab-*`, never `soul-lab-*` or `soul_lab-*`
- Domain references: Always soullab.life, never soul-lab.*

### Brand Evolution
As we grow, the soul/lab duality remains our north star:
- **Soul** keeps us human-centered and sacred
- **Lab** keeps us innovative and precise
- **Soullab** keeps us unified and protected

*"In your Soullab, the precision of technology serves the depth of your soul's unfolding."*
