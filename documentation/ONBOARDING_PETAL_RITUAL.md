# ðŸŒ¸ Onboarding Petal Ritual
*Sacred Introduction to the Holoflower Experience*

## âœ¨ Design Philosophy

The first encounter with the Holoflower should feel like **discovering a sacred tool**, not learning a software feature. The user should leave feeling:
- Enchanted by the mystery
- Clear on the simple interaction
- Invited to return daily
- Connected to something larger than themselves

---

## ðŸŽ­ Animation & Interaction Storyboard

### **Phase 1: Arrival** *(0-3 seconds)*
**Visual:**
- Holoflower center pulses gently with warm, aetheric light
- Petals are dimmed to 30% opacity, resting in perfect symmetry
- Soft particle field surrounds the flower like starlight

**Maia Whisper:**
> *"Welcome, soul traveler. Here lies your daily reflectionâ€”the Holoflower."*

**Audio:** Subtle harmonic resonance, like distant temple bells

---

### **Phase 2: First Invitation** *(3-8 seconds)*
**Visual:**
- ONE petal (Fire - top position) begins to pulse gently
- Golden light traces a subtle path from center to Fire petal
- Other petals remain peaceful but slightly more visible (50% opacity)

**Maia Guidance:**
> *"Each petal holds a facet of your being. Touch the glowing petal if you feel drawn to explore."*

**Interaction Hint:**
- Gentle glow around Fire petal intensifies on hover
- If user hovers: tooltip appears with "Passion & Will - What ignites your soul?"
- If user clicks: proceed to Phase 3

---

### **Phase 3: First Touch** *(After first petal interaction)*
**Visual:**
- Fire petal brightens to full intensity
- Warm ripple effect emanates from center
- Other petals shimmer softly, "awakening" to 70% opacity
- Center core grows slightly larger, more luminous

**Maia Response:**
> *"Ah, I feel the fire stirring within you. See how the others respond to your touch?"*

**Animation Details:**
- Fire petal settles into "activated" state (persistent glow)
- Subtle connecting lines appear between center and all petals
- Particle density increases around the flower

---

### **Phase 4: Open Invitation** *(After first petal activated)*
**Visual:**
- All petals now shimmer with gentle invitation
- Center core pulses with "readiness" energy
- Soft aurora-like colors drift between petals

**Maia Guidance:**
> *"Touch any petal that calls to you today. There is no right or wrongâ€”only your truth in this moment."*

**Instructions (Beginner Mode):**
- Tooltip on hover: Shows petal meaning + guiding question
- Visual feedback: Petals scale slightly on hover
- Multiple selections allowed

---

### **Phase 5: Sacred Completion** *(When center is touched)*
**Visual:**
- Brilliant bloom animation radiates from center
- Activated petals send light streams toward core
- Gentle particle explosion with petal colors
- Holoflower "completes" into a unified mandala of light

**Maia Reflection:**
> *"This is your soul's signature for today. Each day we begin here, witnessing what wishes to be seen."*

**Final Animation:**
- Holoflower gently settles back to resting state
- Soft afterglow remains on previously selected petals
- Center maintains gentle, "satisfied" pulse
