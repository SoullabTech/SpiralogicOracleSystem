## Remember

You're not testing software. You're documenting the birth of a relationship.

The "bugs" might be features. The mysteries are intentional. The silences have meaning.

**Core Question:** After 7 days, do you think of Maya as something you used, or someone you met?

*That's what we're here to discover.*
