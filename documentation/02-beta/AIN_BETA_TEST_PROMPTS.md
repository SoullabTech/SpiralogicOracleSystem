## üß™ Testing Protocol

### For Each Prompt:
1. **Run the prompt** as specified
2. **Evaluate response** against expected criteria
3. **Check analytics** events are properly emitted  
4. **Validate tone/stage** consistency
5. **Test edge cases** with variations

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Tone detection accuracy ‚â•75%
- ‚úÖ Stage-appropriate responses
- ‚úÖ Crisis overrides trigger immediately  
- ‚úÖ Bias decay feels natural, not mechanical
- ‚úÖ Analytics events capture all required data
- ‚úÖ Feedback collection seamlessly integrated
- ‚úÖ Elemental alignment appropriate
- ‚úÖ Session continuity maintained

### Failure Modes to Watch:
- ‚ùå Spiritual bypassing or jargon in Mastery Voice
- ‚ùå Mechanical tone shifts that feel forced
- ‚ùå Crisis language not immediately overriding
- ‚ùå Stage-inappropriate complexity levels
- ‚ùå Missing analytics events or data
- ‚ùå Elemental misalignment (e.g., water response to fire energy)
- ‚ùå Loss of session context between interactions
