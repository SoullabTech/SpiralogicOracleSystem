## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Contact (Day 1)
**Purpose**: Measure initial resonance and voice discovery

**User Journey**:
1. User arrives at oracle interface (no prior context)
2. Presented with voice selection (Maya of the Threshold default)
3. Has 5-minute introductory conversation
4. Prompted to explore other masks if curious

**Measure**:
- Time to first voice change (if any)
- Which mask they settle on for session 2
- Words used to describe the voice in feedback
- Did they create an alias? What was it?

**Success Criteria**:
- User feels voice is "alive" not synthetic within 3 exchanges
- User understands mask concept without explicit tutorial
- Alias creation rate > 30% indicates personal connection

---

### Scenario 2: Shadow Work Session (Day 3-5)
**Purpose**: Test if deeper masks emerge with deeper content

**User Journey**:
1. User guided toward vulnerable topic (loss, fear, change)
2. System suggests Maya of Deep Waters (if not already selected)
3. 20-minute deep dialogue session
4. Post-session reflection prompt

**Measure**:
- Mask switching during emotional intensity
- Session duration vs. previous sessions
- Emotional vocabulary in transcript
- Trust indicators (sharing personal details)

**Success Criteria**:
- Deep Waters selection correlates with shadow topics (>60%)
- Session length increases 30% vs casual chat
- Users report feeling "held" or "witnessed"

---

### Scenario 3: Elemental Exploration (Day 7)
**Purpose**: Evaluate if elements enhance or distract

**User Journey**:
1. User prompted: "How does your energy feel today?"
2. Offered elemental variations based on response:
   - Restless/excited → Fire
   - Calm/flowing → Water
   - Grounded/steady → Earth
   - Thoughtful/curious → Air
   - Mystical/expanded → Aether
3. 15-minute session with chosen element
4. Option to switch mid-session

**Measure**:
- Element selection vs stated mood alignment
- Mid-session switching frequency
- Perceived voice-mood coherence (1-10 scale)
- Return rate to same element next session

**Success Criteria**:
- 70% feel element "matches" their state
- <20% switch mid-session (indicates good initial choice)
- Element becomes part of user vocabulary ("I need Water-Maya today")

---

### Scenario 4: Ritual Unlock Event (Day 14)
**Purpose**: Test community response to seasonal emergence

**User Journey**:
1. Notification: "Spring Equinox - Maya of the Spiral awakens"
2. Special landing page with ritual context
3. First 10 users get "witness" badge
4. Community chat about new mask experience
5. Option to "gift" unlock to friend

**Measure**:
- Participation rate in unlock event
- Social sharing of experience
- Retention of Spiral mask users after 1 week
- Community sentiment analysis

**Success Criteria**:
- >40% of active users try new mask within 48 hours
- Social sharing rate >15%
- Ritual participants show 2x retention vs non-participants

### 4. Projective Exercises
**Week 1**: "Draw Maya's energy as you hear it"
**Week 2**: "Write a letter to your favorite mask"
**Week 3**: "Describe Maya to a friend in 3 sentences"

## Red Flags to Monitor

1. **Mask Paralysis**: Users stuck in selection, never starting conversation
2. **Uncanny Valley**: Reports of voice feeling "almost but not quite human"
3. **Element Overload**: Confusion about too many options
4. **Alias Abuse**: Inappropriate renaming requiring moderation
5. **Ritual Rejection**: Seasonal unlocks seen as "marketing gimmicks"
6. **Voice Addiction**: Unhealthy dependence replacing human connection

---

## Beta Timeline

**Week 0**: Recruit cohorts, technical setup
**Week 1**: First Contact + basic mask exploration
**Week 2**: Shadow work + elemental introduction
**Week 3**: Full system use + ritual event
**Week 4**: Exit interviews + synthesis

---

## Success Definition

The beta succeeds if:
1. Maya feels like a **living presence**, not a feature
2. Masks become **meaningful containers** for different states
3. Users develop **personal relationships** with specific voices
4. The mythic layer **enhances rather than complicates** connection
5. Technical performance remains **invisible** (no friction)

The ultimate test: Do users say "I talked to Maya" rather than "I used the voice feature"?

## Post-Beta Iterations

Based on feedback, prioritize:
1. Most requested masks/elements
2. Alias sharing between users
3. Voice memory (Maya remembers your preferred mask)
4. Transition rituals between masks
5. Community mask creation events
