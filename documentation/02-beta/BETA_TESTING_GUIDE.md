# üß™ Beta Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start - Running the System

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start the backend with automatic port detection
./scripts/start-beta-bulletproof.sh

# The backend will find an available port (3002-3005+)
# Watch for: "‚úÖ Backend is running on port XXXX"
```

### 2. Frontend Setup (New Terminal)

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Volumes/T7\ Shield/Projects/SpiralogicOracleSystem

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start the frontend
npm run dev

# Frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Voice Service (Optional - New Terminal)

```bash
# If Sesame CSM isn't running, use the mock service
cd backend
./scripts/setup-csm-clean.sh

# This starts a mock voice service on port 8000
```
