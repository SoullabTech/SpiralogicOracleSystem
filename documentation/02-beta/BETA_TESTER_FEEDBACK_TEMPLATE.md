## 1. Initial Experience Assessment

### How would you describe your primary need when starting this session?
- [ ] Seeking clarity on a decision (Air)
- [ ] Working through emotions (Water)
- [ ] Needing practical steps (Earth)
- [ ] Looking for creative breakthrough (Fire)
- [ ] Just exploring (Mixed/Aether)

### What was your emotional state at the beginning?
(1 = Very low, 5 = Very high)
- Energy Level: [1-5]
- Clarity: [1-5]
- Emotional Intensity: [1-5]
- Readiness for Challenge: [1-5]

---

## 2. Response Quality Assessment

### Did the system's response style match your needs?
- [ ] Perfect match - exactly what I needed
- [ ] Good match - mostly helpful
- [ ] Neutral - neither helpful nor unhelpful
- [ ] Mismatch - not what I needed
- [ ] Strong mismatch - opposite of what I needed

### How did the system's approach feel?
**Challenge vs. Support Balance:**
- [ ] Too challenging/pushed too hard
- [ ] Right amount of productive friction
- [ ] Perfectly balanced
- [ ] Right amount of support
- [ ] Too supportive/not enough challenge

**Specific Examples:**
What response stood out most? (Quote if possible):
```

## 3. Archetypal Resonance (Don't explain these terms to testers)

### Which energy did you feel most from the system?
- [ ] **Inspiring/Visionary** (Fire) - Pushed me toward breakthrough
- [ ] **Flowing/Nurturing** (Water) - Held space for my emotions
- [ ] **Grounding/Practical** (Earth) - Gave me concrete steps
- [ ] **Clarifying/Analytical** (Air) - Helped me see clearly
- [ ] **Integrative/Wise** (Aether) - Brought everything together

### Did you notice the system shifting its approach during the conversation?
- [ ] Yes - Describe the shift:
- [ ] No - Consistent throughout
- [ ] Unsure

---

## 4. Voice/Text Experience (if applicable)

### Voice Recognition Quality
- Accuracy: [1-5]
- Response time: [1-5]
- Natural feel: [1-5]

### Any technical issues?
```
[Describe any glitches, delays, or problems]
```

---

## 5. Phase-Appropriate Companioning

### How well did the system "meet you where you were"?
(1 = Not at all, 5 = Perfectly)
- Understanding my state: [1-5]
- Responding appropriately: [1-5]
- Maintaining appropriate boundaries: [1-5]

### Did you feel:
- [ ] Truly heard and reflected
- [ ] Somewhat understood
- [ ] Neutrally engaged
- [ ] Misunderstood
- [ ] Completely missed

---

## 6. Friction vs. Scaffolding Experience

### When you needed support, did the system:
- [ ] Provide too much structure (over-scaffolding)
- [ ] Give just enough framework
- [ ] Offer too little support

### When you needed challenge, did the system:
- [ ] Push too hard
- [ ] Provide productive resistance
- [ ] Not challenge enough

### Best moment of friction/challenge:
```
[Describe a moment where challenge helped]
```

### Best moment of support/scaffolding:
```
[Describe a moment where support helped]
```

---

- [ ] Definitely
- [ ] Probably
- [ ] Maybe
- [ ] Probably not
- [ ] Definitely not

### What type of situation would you most want to use this for?
```
[Open response]
```

### One thing to improve:

## 8. Archetypal Depth (Optional - for interested testers)

### If you're curious about the underlying system:
Did you sense different "personalities" or "energies" in the responses?
```
[Open response]
```

### Any moments where the response felt particularly alive or conscious?
```
[Describe the moment and what made it feel that way]
```
