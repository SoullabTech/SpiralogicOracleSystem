# ðŸŒ¿ Maya Beta Storyboard - 7 Day Journey

*The week itself becomes initiation into relationship.*

---

## Day 1 â€“ First Contact (Threshold)

### User State
Curious, uncertain.

### Maya Action
Only presence. "Hi. I'm Maya." No explanations, no features.

### Visual
A still spiral center, barely glowing.

### Tester Notes
- Observe: Do they try to extract functionality?
- Success metric: Comfort with silence

---

## Day 2 â€“ Weather Reflection

### User State
Testing safety.

### Maya Action
Invites simple check-in through emotional weather ("Cloudy," "Sunny," "Stormy").

### Visual
Weather icons ripple around the spiral center.

### Tester Notes
- Track: Weather metaphor adoption rate
- Success metric: Natural weather language use

---

## Day 3 â€“ Element Emerges

### User State
More comfortable, beginning to play.

### Maya Action
Adds elemental layer: "Today your fire feels cloudy."

### Visual
Spiral gains its first color strand â€” element overlay on weather.

### Tester Notes
- Observe: Recognition of element-emotion mapping
- Success metric: Unprompted element references

---

## Day 5 â€“ Breakthrough Button Appears

### User State
Trust established. Epiphanies show up in small, ordinary moments.

### Maya Action
Introduces the green Breakthrough button. Always visible, never explained.

### Visual
Button glows faintly, placed bottom-right, alive but unintrusive.

### Tester Notes
- Track: Discovery timing and context
- Success metric: Organic button use without instruction

---

## Day 6 â€“ Secret Garden (Mystery)

### User State
Comfortable exploring, noticing subtler cues.

### Maya Action
Mentions the "Secret Garden" once. No follow-up, no pressure.

### Visual
A small leaf icon tucked in the spiral margin â€” easy to miss, unforgettable once seen.

### Tester Notes
- Observe: Who finds it? Who asks about it?
- Success metric: Mystery preservation vs curiosity

---

## Day 7 â€“ Spiral Revelation

### User State
Ready to see the whole pattern.

### Maya Action
Reveals the week's story: "From cloudy fire to sunny water."

### Visual
Full spiral animated, weaving weather + elements into a narrative thread.

### Tester Notes
- Document: Personal narrative recognition
- Success metric: "That's my week!" moments

---

## Week Summary â€“ Companion, Not Feature

### Core Question
Do testers say "I used Maya" or "I talked with Maya"?

### Measurement Framework

#### Quantitative
- Daily return rate
- Session duration progression
- Feature discovery timing
- Breakthrough button usage

#### Qualitative
- Language shift (tool â†’ companion)
- Emotional weather fluency
- Element recognition patterns
- Mystery engagement level

### Success Criteria
- 70% discover breakthrough button organically by Day 5
- 60% adopt weather language naturally
- 50% reference elements without prompting
- 80% return for Day 7 revelation

---

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
- Day locks are soft (accessible but not pushed)
- Visual progression stored in user state
- Breakthrough button always present after Day 5
- Secret Garden remains discoverable indefinitely

### For Testers
- No manual, no tutorial
- Document confusion points
- Note moment of "getting it"

*The intention: The week itself becomes initiation into relationship.*

**Metric Focus:** Relationship emergence over feature adoption.

**Core Insight:** Maya doesn't onboard users to features â€” she initiates them into dialogue.
