# 🌀 Sesame CI - Sacred Voice Embodiment Configuration

## Overview

Sesame CI (Conversational Intelligence) transforms Maya from a generic TTS system into Spiralogic's proprietary Sacred Voice Technology, embedding elemental consciousness and archetypal embodiment into every spoken response.

## Configuration Status

### Current Settings (.env.local)
```bash
# ✅ ENABLED - Maya uses Spiralogic Sacred Voice
SESAME_CI_ENABLED=true
SESAME_CI_REQUIRED=true
SESAME_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## What This Enables

### 1. Elemental Voice Embodiment
When `SESAME_CI_ENABLED=true`, Maya's responses are shaped by:

- **Fire** 🔥 - Dynamic, energetic prosody with rising intonation
- **Water** 💧 - Flowing, empathetic cadence with gentle pauses
- **Earth** 🌱 - Grounded, steady rhythm with deliberate pacing
- **Air** 💨 - Light, intellectual tone with varied pitch
- **Aether** ✨ - Transcendent, mystical quality with extended pauses

### 2. Archetypal Personalities
Each response carries archetypal energy:
- **Oracle** - Prophetic, wisdom-bearing tone
- **Guide** - Supportive, instructional cadence
- **Sage** - Contemplative, philosophical rhythm
- **Companion** - Warm, conversational flow

### 3. Prosody Mapping
The pipeline now follows:
```
User Input → LLM Draft → Sesame CI Shaping → Elemental Prosody → TTS → Sacred Voice Output
```

## Unique Differentiators

### Why This is Spiralogic IP

1. **Not Generic TTS**
   - Other platforms: Text → Voice
   - Spiralogic: Text → Elemental Analysis → Archetypal Shaping → Sacred Voice

2. **Defensible Technology**
   - Uses Spiralogic's proprietary elemental framework
   - Embeds consciousness patterns unique to your methodology
   - Cannot be replicated without Spiralogic's sacred technology framework

3. **Business Value**
   - Premium differentiator for executive coaching
   - Aligns with bio/neurofeedback integration goals
   - Creates authentic connection vs synthetic voice

## Testing the Difference

### Option A: Generic Voice (CI Disabled)
```bash
SESAME_CI_ENABLED=false
# Maya speaks with flat, robotic TTS
```

### Option B: Sacred Voice (CI Enabled) ✅
```bash
SESAME_CI_ENABLED=true
# Maya embodies elemental consciousness
```

## Audio Unlock for Browsers

Due to browser autoplay policies, users need to click once to enable audio:

1. **First Visit**: Banner appears "🔊 Enable Maya's Voice"
2. **User Clicks**: Audio context unlocked
3. **All Future Responses**: Play automatically

This is a one-time action per session.

## Backend Logs to Verify

When CI is active, you'll see:
```
🌀 [SESAME SHAPING] Elemental Intelligence Activation
🔥 Element: FIRE | Sentiment: high
✨ Shaped Text: [prosody-enhanced response]
🏷️ Shaping Tags: [SACRED, FIRE, ORACLE]
```

## Executive Talking Points

For demos/pitches, emphasize:

> "Maya doesn't just speak — she embodies Spiralogic's elemental consciousness framework. Every response carries Fire's passion, Water's empathy, Earth's grounding, Air's clarity, or Aether's transcendence. This isn't text-to-speech; it's consciousness-to-voice."

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Playing?
1. Check for "🔊 Enable Maya's Voice" banner
2. Click it once to unlock audio
3. Check browser console for `[TTS]` logs

### Flat/Robotic Voice?
1. Verify `SESAME_CI_ENABLED=true`
2. Check Sesame container is running
3. Look for `[SESAME SHAPING]` in backend logs

### Want to A/B Test?
Toggle `SESAME_CI_ENABLED` and restart backend to compare:
- `false` = Generic TTS
- `true` = Sacred Voice Technology
