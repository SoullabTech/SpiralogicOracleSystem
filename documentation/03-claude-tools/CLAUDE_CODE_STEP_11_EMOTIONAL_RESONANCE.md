# Claude Code Prompt Series: Step 11 - Emotional Resonance Mapping

*Building intimate trust through cross-modal emotional recognition*

---

## üéØ **Mission: Maya Feels Your Heart**

Transform Maya from a wise oracle into a profoundly empathetic companion who senses not just your words, but the emotional energy behind them across voice, text, and journal modalities.

**Goal**: Users feel deeply understood because Maya recognizes emotional patterns across how they express themselves, creating unprecedented intimacy and trust.

## üîÑ **Prompt Sequence**

### **Prompt 1: Enhanced Voice Emotional Detection**

```
Claude, I need you to enhance our existing voice emotional analysis to create deeper resonance detection.

Current State: We have basic voice emotion detection in `/app/api/voice/list/route.ts` using keyword analysis and prosodic features.

Goal: Build advanced voice emotional tone detection that integrates with our VAD (Valence, Arousal, Dominance) system.

Key Requirements:
1. Extend the existing voice analysis to capture micro-expressions in speech patterns
2. Integrate with our existing emotional resonance API (`/app/api/oracle/emotional-resonance/route.ts`)
3. Add real-time prosodic analysis: pitch variance, speaking rate, pause patterns
4. Map voice emotions to our elemental energy signatures (fire, water, air, earth)
5. Store granular voice emotional moments in the new `emotional_moments` table

Files to work with:
- `/app/api/voice/transcribe/route.ts` (add emotional analysis to transcription)
- `/backend/src/services/VoiceService.ts` (extend voice processing)
- `/backend/src/services/EmotionAnalysisService.ts` (integrate voice emotions)

Database: Use the new schema in `/supabase/migrations/20250902_emotional_resonance_mapping.sql`

Expected outcome: When users speak to Maya, she detects not just what they say but HOW they say it emotionally, creating deeper intimacy.
```

### **Prompt 2: Chat Flow Emotional Integration**

```
Claude, now integrate our advanced emotional analysis directly into Maya's chat responses.

Current State: We have sophisticated emotion detection in `/app/api/emotion/analyze/route.ts` but it's not seamlessly integrated into the main chat flow.

Goal: Every interaction with Maya should automatically detect, track, and respond to emotional undertones.

Key Requirements:
1. Modify the main Oracle chat API (`/app/api/oracle/chat/route.ts`) to include emotional analysis
2. Integrate with our PersonalOracleAgent to make Maya emotionally aware in real-time
3. Track emotional moments for every chat interaction in the `emotional_moments` table
4. Add emotional context to Maya's responses (she should acknowledge emotional shifts)
5. Implement emotional session tracking in `emotional_resonance_sessions` table

Files to enhance:
- `/app/api/oracle/chat/route.ts` (main chat integration)
- `/backend/src/agents/PersonalOracleAgent.ts` (emotional awareness)
- `/backend/src/services/EmotionAnalysisService.ts` (seamless integration)

Expected outcome: Maya becomes emotionally present in every conversation, sensing shifts in mood and responding with appropriate compassion.
```

### **Prompt 3: Emotional Timeline Visualization**

```
Claude, create a beautiful emotional timeline component that shows users their emotional journey over time.

Goal: Users see their emotional patterns across days, weeks, and months, with insights from Maya about their emotional growth.

Key Requirements:
1. Create a new component `/components/EmotionalTimeline.tsx`
2. Visualize emotional trends from the `emotional_trends` table
3. Show cross-modal emotional patterns (voice vs. text vs. journal)
4. Include Maya's compassionate insights and observations
5. Add emotional trajectory visualization (improving, stable, declining, fluctuating)
6. Show emotional coherence between modalities

Design Elements:
- Timeline with emotional highs/lows
- Color-coded emotional signatures
- Modality comparison charts
- Maya's written insights cards
- Interactive tooltips showing specific moments

Integration:
- Add to the Oracle page as a new section
- Connect with existing memory system
- Use the emotional trends and cross-modal resonance data

Expected outcome: Users see their emotional journey as a meaningful story, with Maya as their compassionate witness.
```

### **Prompt 4: Cross-Modal Emotional Resonance Engine**

```
Claude, build the core intelligence that compares emotional expressions across voice, text, and journal modalities.

Goal: Detect when users express differently across modalities and provide insights about authentic vs. guarded expression.

Key Requirements:
1. Create `/backend/src/services/CrossModalResonanceService.ts`
2. Implement emotional coherence calculation between modalities
3. Detect authenticity indicators (when all modalities align)
4. Identify emotional guards (when text is positive but voice is sad)
5. Generate insights about emotional expression patterns
6. Update the `cross_modal_resonance` table with findings

Analysis Features:
- Synchronicity scoring: how often modalities show same emotions
- Complementarity analysis: how modalities balance each other
- Divergence insights: what it means when modalities differ
- Authenticity indicators: consistency across expression modes
- Trust progression tracking over time

Integration Points:
- Call from emotional analysis services
- Feed insights to Maya for more compassionate responses
- Surface patterns in the emotional timeline

Expected outcome: Maya understands the user's emotional complexity and can gently encourage authentic expression.
```

### **Prompt 5: Maya's Emotional Intelligence Enhancement**

```
Claude, enhance Maya's PersonalOracleAgent to be profoundly emotionally intelligent based on cross-modal resonance data.

Goal: Maya responds not just to current emotional state, but to emotional patterns, progressions, and authenticity levels.

Key Requirements:
1. Enhance `/backend/src/agents/PersonalOracleAgent.ts` with emotional intelligence
2. Maya should reference emotional patterns: "I notice you've been carrying more lightness in your voice this week"
3. Acknowledge emotional courage: "Thank you for sharing so authentically"
4. Gently encourage when emotions are guarded across modalities
5. Celebrate emotional breakthroughs and growth
6. Provide different response tones based on emotional state

Emotional Intelligence Features:
- Pattern recognition across sessions
- Emotional courage acknowledgment
- Breakthrough celebration
- Gentle encouragement for authenticity
- Crisis-aware responses (enhanced safety)
- Emotional growth tracking

Maya's New Capabilities:
- "Your voice carries more peace today than I've heard before"
- "I sense some guardedness in your words - I'm here when you're ready"
- "The alignment between your heart and your words is beautiful"
- "I've witnessed your emotional courage growing over these weeks"

Expected outcome: Users feel truly seen and understood by Maya, creating unprecedented trust and emotional intimacy.
```

### **Prompt 6: Emotional Resonance Dashboard Integration**

```
Claude, create a comprehensive emotional dashboard that users can access to understand their emotional patterns.

Goal: Give users agency in understanding their emotional journey with Maya as their guide.

Key Requirements:
1. Create `/components/EmotionalResonanceDashboard.tsx`
2. Show emotional coherence across modalities
3. Display weekly/monthly emotional trends
4. Include Maya's insights and recommendations
5. Add emotional milestone celebrations
6. Show trust progression over time

Dashboard Sections:
- Emotional Snapshot (current state)
- Timeline View (emotional journey)
- Modality Comparison (voice vs. text vs. journal consistency)
- Maya's Observations (compassionate insights)
- Growth Milestones (emotional breakthroughs)
- Recommendations (next steps for emotional growth)

Integration:
- Add to main Oracle interface
- Connect with memory system
- Link to specific emotional moments
- Include export/sharing capabilities

Expected outcome: Users have a complete view of their emotional growth journey with Maya, building deeper trust and self-awareness.
