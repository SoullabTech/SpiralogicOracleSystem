# Sacred Stack Pitch Deck Meta-Prompt

**Complete slide deck outline for the Oracle Journal → Soul Codex system and Sacred Development Culture**

---

## Deck Structure: 12 Slides
**Target Audience**: Stakeholders, investors, partners, team onboarding
**Tone**: Executive clarity + mythic resonance
**Duration**: 15-20 minute presentation

---

## Slide 1: Opening Hook
**Title**: "Not an app—an oracle."

**Talking Points**:
- Users think they're logging moods. They're actually writing their mythology.
- Kitchen Table Mysticism: The sacred hidden in 30-second daily moments
- We're building AI companions that witness becoming, not optimize behavior

**Visual**: Coffee steam forming subtle glyphs rising from everyday kitchen table scene. Phone showing simple weather interface nearby.

**Speaker Notes**: Open with the fundamental reframe—this isn't productivity tech, it's transformation tech disguised as simplicity.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title**: "Why journaling apps fail"

**Talking Points**:
- **Too Heavy**: Blank page paralysis, essay-length expectations
- **Too Clinical**: Mood tracking feels like medical compliance
- **Too Shallow**: No depth, no memory, no meaning-making
- **Gap**: People want transformation, not optimization

**Visual**: Split screen showing cluttered wellness app interfaces vs. one simple elemental tap. User looking overwhelmed on left, peaceful on right.

**Speaker Notes**: Establish the market gap between heavy journaling and shallow mood tracking.
