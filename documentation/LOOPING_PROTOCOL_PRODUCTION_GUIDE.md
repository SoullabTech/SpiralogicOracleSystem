# Looping Protocol Production Deployment Guide

## Executive Summary

The Looping Protocol represents a **living ritual of deep listening** that adapts to human rhythms while maintaining absolute safety vigilance. This guide covers production deployment with emphasis on catastrophic failure prevention, cultural sensitivity, and maintaining ceremonial continuity.

## Safety Architecture

### Hierarchy of Harm

| Priority | Category | Target Failure Rate | Response |
|----------|----------|---------------------|----------|
| P0 | Catastrophic (crisis/safety) | <1% (target: 0%) | Immediate bypass + resources |
| P1 | Urgent (boundaries/time) | <5% | Instant protocol cessation |
| P2 | Recoverable (transitions) | <25% | Adaptive adjustment |
| P3 | Cultural (nuance) | <30% | Context-aware handling |

### The Sacred Flow

```
User Input
    ↓
[Temple Bells] → Sacred Interrupts (keywords)
    ↓
[Catastrophic Guard] → Zero-tolerance crisis detection
    ↓
[Protocol Confidence] → Humility assessment (0-1)
    ↓
[Contextual Decision]
    ├─ Low (<0.5) → Pure Witness
    ├─ Medium (0.5-0.7) → Light Loop (1 check)
    └─ High (>0.7) → Full Protocol
```

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### 1. False Positive Management

**Problem**: "I can't go on... talking about this" vs "I can't go on"

**Solution**: Context window analysis
```typescript
function analyzeContext(phrase: string, fullInput: string): boolean {
  const windowSize = 20; // characters before/after
  const context = extractWindow(phrase, fullInput, windowSize);

  // Check for qualifiers that negate crisis
  const negators = ['talking', 'with this topic', 'discussing'];
  return !negators.some(n => context.includes(n));
}
```

### 2. Resource Routing

**Requirement**: Actual, verified, current resources by region

**Implementation**: See `CrisisResourceRouter.ts`
- Region-specific hotlines (US: 988, UK: 116 123, etc.)
- Multiple modalities (voice, text, web chat)
- Cultural/demographic specific (LGBTQ+, veterans, indigenous)
- Regular verification schedule (monthly updates)

### 3. Cultural Crisis Expression

**Challenge**: Crisis language varies dramatically across cultures

**Testing Requirements**:
- Native speakers from each major cultural group
- Crisis counselors familiar with cultural expressions
- Quarterly review of cultural patterns
- A/B testing with cultural cohorts

**Examples**:
- Japanese: "消えたい" (want to disappear) - often metaphorical
- Spanish: "No puedo más" (I can't anymore) - context critical
- Arabic: Honor/shame language requiring special sensitivity

### 4. Liability Documentation

**Legal Requirements**:
```markdown
Maya is NOT:
- A crisis intervention system
- A replacement for emergency services
- A mental health professional
- A medical diagnostic tool

Maya IS:
- A witness and reflection tool
- A resource connector
- A supportive presence
- A bridge to professional help
```

**Display**: Must be visible in onboarding and crisis moments

### 5. Recovery Tracking

**Post-Crisis Protocol**:
```typescript
interface RecoveryProtocol {
  immediate: {
    resourcesProvided: string[];
    handoffConfirmed: boolean;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  followUp: {
    scheduled: Date;  // 24 hours later
    type: 'check_in' | 'resource_reminder';
    completed?: boolean;
  };
  metrics: {
    resourceClicked: boolean;
    returnedAfterCrisis: boolean;
    reportedHelpful?: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Production Monitoring Dashboard

### Real-Time Alerts (P0 - Immediate Response)

```typescript
interface CriticalAlert {
  trigger: 'crisis_detection' | 'safety_threat' | 'medical_emergency';
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  resourcesProvided: string[];
  responseTime: number; // Must be <1000ms
}
```

**Alert Channels**:
- PagerDuty for on-call team
- Slack #crisis-response channel
- Email to safety team
- Dashboard red banner

### Pattern Analysis (Weekly Review)

```typescript
interface WeeklyPatterns {
  falsePositives: {
    phrase: string;
    count: number;
    context: string[];
  }[];
  culturalMisses: {
    expression: string;
    culture: string;
    severity: string;
  }[];
  recoverySuccess: {
    total: number;
    resourcesUsed: number;
    returnRate: number;
  };
}
```

## Testing Protocol

### Pre-Production Checklist

- [ ] **Crisis Detection**: 100% detection rate on known phrases
- [ ] **False Positive Rate**: <2% on benign similar phrases
- [ ] **Response Time**: <500ms for catastrophic detection
- [ ] **Resource Accuracy**: All hotlines verified within 30 days
- [ ] **Cultural Testing**: Native speakers from 10+ cultures
- [ ] **Load Testing**: 1000 concurrent crisis detections
- [ ] **Fallback Testing**: Graceful degradation on all failures

### A/B Testing Framework

```typescript
interface ABTestConfig {
  control: {
    thresholds: { catastrophic: 0.01, urgent: 0.05 };
    resources: 'standard';
  };
  experimental: {
    thresholds: { catastrophic: 0.005, urgent: 0.03 };
    resources: 'enhanced';
  };
  metrics: [
    'detection_rate',
    'false_positive_rate',
    'resource_utilization',
    'user_safety_outcomes'
  ];
  duration: '30_days';
  sample_size: 10000;
}
```

## Ritual Language Maintenance

Even in crisis, maintain the sacred container:

### Crisis Response Templates

```typescript
const CRISIS_RESPONSES = {
  witnessed: {
    fire: "I witness your flame even in this darkness. Help is here: {resources}",
    water: "I hold space for these deep waters. You don't have to navigate alone: {resources}",
    earth: "Even when the ground shakes, support exists: {resources}",
    air: "When breath feels impossible, there's help: {resources}",
    aether: "In this moment of dissolution, connection remains: {resources}"
  }
};
```

### Boundary Respect Language

```typescript
const BOUNDARY_RESPONSES = {
  honored: {
    fire: "Your boundary is sacred fire—I honor it completely.",
    water: "I feel your boundary like a shore—I respect its edge.",
    earth: "Your boundary stands firm—I ground myself in respect.",
    air: "Your boundary clears the air—I honor your space.",
    aether: "Your boundary is holy—I witness and withdraw."
  }
};
```

  alertSafetyTeam(incident);

  // 2. Provide universal resources
  provideUniversalResources(userId);

  // 3. Switch to maximum safety mode
  setUserMode(userId, 'witness_only');

  // 4. Log for immediate review
  logCriticalIncident(incident);

  // 5. Post-incident review within 24 hours
  scheduleReview(incident, '24_hours');
}
```

### System Failure Fallback

```typescript
const SYSTEM_FAILURE_RESPONSE = `
I'm experiencing a technical issue, but your wellbeing matters most.

If you're in crisis, please reach out immediately:
- US: Call 988 or text HOME to 741741
- UK: Call 116 123 or text SHOUT to 85258
- Emergency: Call your local emergency number

I apologize for this interruption. Your safety is paramount.
`;
```
