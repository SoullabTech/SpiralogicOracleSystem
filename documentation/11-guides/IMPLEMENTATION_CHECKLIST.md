- [ ] Prepare PR materials

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have Before Launch
1. **Safety System**: 100% functional crisis detection
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Not therapy messaging everywhere
3. **Simple Value**: One clear benefit in first session
4. **Privacy Controls**: Easy data deletion
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation

### Success Metrics
- 70% complete first session
- 50% return for session 2
- 0 safety incidents
- <2s response time
- <$0.50 per user cost

### Red Flags to Monitor
- Users asking "what is this?"
- Confusion about purpose
- Safety boundary crossing
- Technical errors >1%
- User drop-off >50%

## Post-Launch Iterations

### Based on Feedback
- Further simplification if needed
- Feature additions only if requested
- Performance optimizations
- Scaling preparations
- Premium tier planning

### Future Considerations
- Slowly reintroduce depth
- Test advanced features
- Build community features
- Add professional partnerships
- Expand internationally

Remember: **Simple first, magical later**. The depth can return once core value is proven.
