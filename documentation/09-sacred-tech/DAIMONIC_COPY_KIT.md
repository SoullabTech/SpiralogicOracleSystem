# Daimonic Copy Kit
**Production-Ready Language for the Daimon-as-Other Integration**

## Core Philosophy

The Daimonic system treats the Daimon as genuine Other—not self-optimization, but dialogue with an alive intelligence that tests, teaches, and transforms through riddles, thresholds, and both-and tensions.

## UI Copy Elements

### Chips & Status Indicators

**Primary Chips:**
- `Threshold time` (amber) - Liminal moments when insight arrives sideways
- `Teaching riddle likely` (amber) - Trickster energy present, slow down
- `Hold both registers` (purple) - Both-and signature detected
- `Spirit-soul dialogue` (green) - Integration between ascent and descent

**Micro-Status:**
- `Field is testing through riddles` - Collective banner when trickster prevalence high
- `Teaching patterns active` - Subtle indicator for moderate trickster activity
- `High intensity` / `Moderate activity` / `Quiet field` - Field intensity states

### Micro-Prompts (Action-Oriented)

**Grounding Prompts:**
- "Ask one grounding question."
- "Name one small truth aloud."
- "Do one finishable step."
- "Sit with the unfamiliar for a moment."
- "Notice what feels solid and real right now."

**Reality Check Prompts:**
- "Try one small check-in with reality before moving."
- "What's one concrete step you can take?"

### Practice Tiles (Time-Bounded)

**Quick Practices:**
- "Kitchen-table check-in" (5 min)
- "Fact & symbol journaling" (7 min)  
- "One-step embodiment" (3 min walk + breath)

## Narrative Language Patterns

### Individual Opening Lines

**Liminal-Aware:**
- "You're at a threshold time—ideas arrive sideways here."
- "Dawn energy—insights tend to slip in sideways here."
- "Dusk reflection—the veil between worlds thins."
- "Midnight wisdom—something shifts in the deep hours."

**Steady Ground:**
- "Today feels steady enough to tell the truth gently."

### Spirit-Soul Pull Guidance

**Spirit Pull (Fire + Air dominance):**
- "There's lift in the system. Meet it with one embodied step you can finish today."

**Soul Pull (Water + Earth dominance):**
- "Depth is leading; keep it specific—body, breath, kitchen-table truths."

**Integration (Balanced):**
- "Ascent and descent are in dialogue—conditions favor clean moves."

### Both-And Signature

**Core Guidance:**
- "Hold fact and symbol at once; don't collapse the mystery into either box."

### Trickster Caution

**High Risk (≥0.5):**
- "This may be a teaching riddle. Slow the pace, verify with reality, and ask one grounding question."

**Moderate Risk (0.3-0.5):**
- "Teaching patterns may be at work—stay curious and verify with the real."

### Closing Lines

**Individual:**
- "Let what meets you remain a little unfamiliar. That gap is where something new can happen."

**Group:**
- "The group is practicing honest descent this week—simple, specific actions tend to move everyone forward."

**Anti-Solipsism Check:**
- "Perfect agreement can mean you're only hearing yourself. Leave a little room for surprise."

## Voice Presets & Tags

### Preset Applications

**Trickster Caution:**
- Voice tags: `[measured]` `[grounded tone]`
- Personality adaptation:
  - Aunt Annie: `[thoughtful pause] Let's take this slowly…`
  - Emily: `[measured] Try one small check-in with reality before moving.`

**Threshold:**
- Voice tags: `[soft pace]` `[thoughtful pause]`

**Both-And:**
- Voice tags: `[warm]` `[spacious]`

**Anti-Solipsism:**
- Voice tags: `[gentle humor]`

### Grounding Prompts by Voice

**General:**
- "Let's take this slowly…"
- "Try one small check-in with reality before moving."

**Threshold-Specific:**
- "Notice what feels solid and real right now."

## Group & Collective Language

### Group Patterns

**Threshold Group:**
- "Expect playful tests and mixed signals; agreement may lag insight. Keep checks gentle and real."

**Teaching Riddle Group:**
- "Teaching riddles may be present in group dynamics. Trust the process, stay curious."

### Collective Myths (Dynamic)

**High Trickster + High Intensity:**
- "Learning through sacred mischief and teaching riddles"

**High Both-And + High Intensity:**
- "Practicing the art of holding multiple truths simultaneously"

**General High Intensity:**
- "Navigating threshold times with careful attention"

**Spirit-Heavy Collective:**
- "Seeking grounded expression for elevated insights"

**Soul-Heavy Collective:**
- "Deepening into embodied wisdom and practical truth"

**Default:**
- "Learning to hold paradox with grace"

### Cultural Compensation Patterns

Rotating based on field characteristics:
- "Balancing abstraction with embodiment"
- "Balancing overwhelm with a single clear view"
- "Balancing speed with depth"
- "Balancing individual insight with collective wisdom"
- "Balancing certainty with healthy mystery"
- "Balancing action with reflection"

## Expert Mode Language

### Internal Field Labels
- `Trickster Risk: 62%`
- `Liminal: 45%`
- `Both-And: Yes`
- `Pull: spirit/soul/integrated`

### Trickster Reason Codes
- `contradiction` - Paradoxical content detected
- `promise` - Future-heavy language
- `wink` - Playful/humor markers
- `test` - Challenge/experiment language

## Safety & Ethics Language

### Anti-Pathologizing
- Frame crises as "sacred ordeal" not diagnostic categories
- Use "teaching riddle" not "confusion" or "chaos"
- "Both-and signature" not "cognitive dissonance"

### Anti-Solipsism
- "Perfect agreement can mean you're only hearing yourself"
- "Leave a little room for surprise"
- "Trust the gap between understanding and mystery"

## Implementation Notes

### Tone Guidelines
- **Phenomenological-first:** Speak to lived experience, not abstract concepts
- **Language-grounded:** Use everyday metaphors (kitchen-table, breath, concrete steps)
- **Non-diagnostic:** Avoid clinical or pathological framing
- **Both-and friendly:** Hold multiple truths without collapse

### Frequency Limits
- Individual: Max one "teaching riddle" caution per day per user
- Group: Gentle integration, not overwhelming
- Expert mode: Available but not default

### Voice Integration
- Tags prepend to existing text
- Grounding prompts for high trickster risk only
- Preset switching based on detection threshold
- Personality-aware modulation

This copy kit provides the exact language patterns needed to land the Daimon-as-Other experience while maintaining the phenomenological, everyday voice that keeps it real and accessible.
