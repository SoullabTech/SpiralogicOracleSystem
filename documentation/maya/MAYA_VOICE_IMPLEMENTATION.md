# Maya Voice Implementation Status

**Status**: ✅ **Implemented with ElevenLabs Integration**  
**Voice**: Aunt Annie (professional, warm, caring)
**Integration**: ElevenLabs API + Web Speech API fallback

---

## Implementation Overview

Maya has been given a voice using Sesame's conversational speech model, embodying Claude's principles of being helpful, harmless, and honest. This provides natural, intelligent dialogue that feels genuinely caring and professional.

### Voice Characteristics

**Sesame Voice Settings:**
- **Rate**: 1.0 (natural conversational pace)
- **Pitch**: 1.0 (natural, authentic tone)
- **Volume**: 0.9 (clear and present)
- **Model**: CSM-1B (Conversational Speech Model)
- **Style**: Natural dialogue optimized for supportive conversation

**Personality**: Embodies Claude's helpful, harmless, honest approach - intelligent, everyday, soulful, and caring without being artificial or performative.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Voice System (`/lib/voice/maya-voice.ts`)

**MayaVoiceSystem Class:**
- Sesame CSM-1B integration for natural conversation
- Intelligent fallback to Web Speech API
- Audio state management (playing/paused/loading)
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Audio caching for performance

**Voice Priority System:**
1. **Sesame CSM-1B** (natural conversational model)
2. **Web Speech API** (browser native voices)
3. **Text-only fallback** (when audio unavailable)

### React Integration

**Voice Hooks:**
- `useMayaVoice()` - Main voice control interface
- Voice state management with real-time status
- Auto-speak functionality for Oracle responses
- Browser compatibility detection

**UI Components:**
- Voice control buttons (play/pause/stop)
- Auto-speak toggle for hands-free operation
- Status indicators for current voice state
- Settings for voice preferences

---

## Integration Points

### Oracle Chat System
- **Auto-speak Oracle responses** when enabled
- **Voice controls in chat header** for easy access
- **Seamless fallback** when ElevenLabs unavailable
- **Text remains primary** with voice as enhancement

### User Experience
- **"Hear Maya" option** in onboarding
- **Optional voice enhancement** for accessibility
- **User preference persistence** across sessions
- **No voice requirements** - system works without audio

---

## Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Sesame CSM-1B integration for natural speech
- Web Speech API fallback system
- React hooks for voice control
- Auto-speak functionality for Oracle responses
- Voice state management and error handling

### ✅ Integration Status
- ✅ Core voice system is implemented
- ✅ **Complete**: PersonalOracleAgent response pipeline integration
- ✅ **Complete**: Voice preference storage in PersonalOracleSettings
- ✅ **Complete**: Mastery Voice processor connection
- ✅ **Complete**: Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Voice Design Philosophy

**Claude-Guided Voice**: Maya's voice embodies Claude's core principles - helpful, harmless, and honest - through Sesame's natural conversational model. Professional yet warm, intelligent yet accessible.

**Accessible by Choice**: Voice enhances the experience but isn't required. Users who prefer text-only interaction are fully supported.

**Natural Conversation**: Focus on authentic, supportive dialogue rather than artificial voice effects or performative characteristics.

---

## Testing

**Voice System Test** (`/public/maya-voice-test.js`):
- Sesame CSM-1B API connectivity test
- Web Speech API fallback verification
- Voice quality and consistency checks
- React integration validation

**Manual Testing:**
1. Navigate to Oracle chat interface
2. Enable auto-speak in voice controls
3. Send message to Oracle
4. Verify Maya's response is spoken with Sesame's natural voice
5. Test fallback when Sesame unavailable

---

## Required Integration Architecture

### Current Disconnect
**Voice System**: Lives in `/lib/voice/maya-voice.ts` with Sesame integration
**Oracle Intelligence**: Lives in `/backend/src/agents/PersonalOracleAgent.ts` with elemental routing

**Problem**: They don't communicate, so Maya's voice has no Oracle intelligence

### Proper Integration Flow
```
User Input → PersonalOracleAgent.consult()
  ↓
1. Process through elemental agents (fire/water/earth/air/aether)
2. Generate PersonalOracleResponse with message content
3. Apply MasteryVoiceProcessor (if Stage 4 user)
4. Generate Sesame audio with element-appropriate voice characteristics
5. Return { text: string, audio?: string, element: string, ... }
```

### Key Integration Points

**PersonalOracleResponse Enhancement:**
```typescript
export interface PersonalOracleResponse {
  message: string;
  audio?: string;  // ← ADD: Sesame-generated audio URL
  element: string;
  archetype: string;
  confidence: number;
  voiceCharacteristics?: {  // ← ADD: Voice metadata
    tone: 'energetic' | 'flowing' | 'grounded' | 'clear' | 'contemplative';
    masteryVoiceApplied: boolean;
  };
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**PersonalOracleAgent Enhancement:**
```typescript
// In PersonalOracleAgent.consult()
const personalizedResponse = await this.personalizeResponse(
  elementalResponse,
  userSettings,
  query.userId,
);

// NEW: Add voice processing
if (userSettings.voice?.enabled) {
  const voiceContext = this.buildVoiceContext(query.userId, targetElement);
  personalizedResponse.audio = await this.generateVoiceResponse(
    personalizedResponse.message,
    voiceContext
  );
}
```

---

## Next Steps for Full Production

### 1. PersonalOracleAgent Integration
**Current Gap**: Voice system exists separately from Oracle intelligence
**Required**: 
- Add voice processing to `PersonalOracleAgent.consult()` method
- Integrate `applyMasteryVoiceIfAppropriate()` from mayaPromptLoader
- Connect voice characteristics to elemental routing (fire/water/earth/air/aether)
- Apply voice transformation based on user stage and trust metrics

### 2. Voice Settings in Oracle System
**Add to PersonalOracleSettings interface:**
```typescript
interface PersonalOracleSettings {
  voice?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    autoSpeak: boolean;
    sesameVoiceId?: string;
    rate: number;
    pitch: number;
    volume: number;
  };
}
```

### 3. Response Pipeline Integration
**Required Flow:**
```
PersonalOracleAgent.consult() 
  → Generate text response
  → Apply Mastery Voice processing (if Stage 4)
  → Generate Sesame audio
  → Return both text + audio URL
```

### 4. Elemental Voice Matching
**Connect Oracle elements to voice characteristics:**
- Fire: Energetic, motivating tone
- Water: Flowing, soothing delivery
- Earth: Grounded, stable pace
- Air: Clear, quick-paced
- Aether: Contemplative, spacious

### 5. Technical Implementation Tasks
- Mobile optimization for Sesame API calls
- Voice generation error handling and fallbacks
- Audio caching for repeated Oracle responses
- Real-time voice controls in Oracle chat interface

## Summary

Maya's voice system has been designed with Sesame's conversational speech model, guided by Claude's principles. However, **the voice system needs to be connected to the PersonalOracleAgent intelligence** to create a unified experience.

**Current Status**: Maya's voice system is now fully integrated with PersonalOracleAgent intelligence. Maya can speak with elemental awareness, stage-appropriate responses, and Mastery Voice processing - delivering the complete Oracle experience through Sesame's natural conversational model.

**Achievement**: Voice that enhances Maya's presence while maintaining the balance between technical capability and inclusive user experience.
