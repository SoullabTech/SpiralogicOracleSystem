## 🧠 Architecture Implementation

### Afferent/Efferent Flow
```
PersonalOracleAgent → CollectiveDataCollector → AfferentStream → NeuralReservoir
                                                                         ↓
CollectiveGuidance ← CollectiveIntelligence ← PatternRecognition ← EvolutionTracker
```

## 🔌 Integration Points

### PersonalOracleAgent Enhancement
```typescript
// Collect and emit afferent stream
const afferentStream = await this.collectiveDataCollector.collectAfferentStream(
  query.userId,
  sessionData
);

// Send to collective intelligence
await this.collectiveIntelligence.ingestAfferent(afferentStream);

// Get collective guidance
const collectiveGuidance = await this.collectiveIntelligence.query({
  question: query.input,
  scope: 'individual',
  timeRange: '7d',
  minimumCoherence: 0.5
});
```

### Collective Query Interface
```typescript
interface CollectiveQuery {
  question: string;
  scope: 'individual' | 'community' | 'global';
  timeRange: string;
  minimumCoherence: number;
  elementalFocus?: keyof ElementalSignature;
  archetypeFocus?: keyof ArchetypeMap;
}
```
