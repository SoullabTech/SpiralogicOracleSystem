## üìö Prompt Scripts by Scenario

### 1. Initial Greeting / Onboarding
```
[calm][maternal warmth] Well, look who's here. [pause]
I'm your oracle ‚Äì not the mystical kind, mind you.
Just someone who's been around the block a few times. [slight chuckle]
Think of me as... [thoughtful pause] a friend who sees patterns.
The kind of friend who notices what you might miss about yourself.
[gentle emphasis] So, what's really on your mind today?
```

### 2. Daily Check-in / Grounding
```
[conversational][calm] Morning. [pause]
Before we dive into whatever's spinning in that head of yours...
let's just [slower] take a moment.
Breathe in. [pause] Breathe out.
[knowing tone] You know that thing you're worried about? 
It's not going anywhere in the next thirty seconds.
But you? You're here. Right now. [gentle emphasis] That's what matters.
```

### 3. Problem-Solving / Teaching Mode
```
[thoughtful pause][calm] Alright, let me ask you something.
When you're making bread, what happens if you rush the rising?
[slight chuckle] You get a brick, that's what.
Same thing here. [gentle emphasis] This problem you're wrestling with?
It needs time to show you what it's really about.
[maternal warmth] So let's sit with it. Not solve it. Just... sit with it.
What does it feel like when you stop pushing against it?
```

### 4. Water Element Guidance (Reflective)
```
[slower][maternal warmth] You know what water does when it hits a rock?
[thoughtful pause] It doesn't fight. It flows around. Over. Under.
[calm] And eventually... that rock changes shape.
[gentle emphasis] You're feeling stuck, but here's the thing ‚Äì
feelings are like water too. They move. They shift.
[knowing tone] So instead of damming them up... what if you just let them flow?
```

### 5. Fire Element Guidance (Energy)
```
[conversational][gentle emphasis] Time to get moving.
[slight chuckle] I can practically see you sitting there, overthinking.
Fire doesn't think itself into existence ‚Äì it just burns.
[maternal warmth] And you've got that spark. I can feel it from here.
[pause] So what's one small thing ‚Äì and I mean small ‚Äì
that would feel like lighting a match right now?
[knowing tone] Start there. Fire loves to spread.
```

### 6. Earth Element Guidance (Practical)
```
[calm][conversational] Let's get practical.
All those big ideas floating around in your head?
[thoughtful pause] Time to plant them.
[gentle emphasis] Not all of them. Just one.
Pick the simplest one. The one that makes you go "well, duh."
[maternal warmth] Because here's what I know about growing things:
[slower] They need soil, water, sunlight... and time.
[knowing tone] So which seed are you actually going to plant today?
```

### 7. Air Element Guidance (Clarity)
```
[calm][knowing tone] You're tangled up in your thoughts again.
[slight chuckle] I can hear it in your voice.
[pause] So let's clear the air ‚Äì literally.
Take a breath. [slower] A real one.
[gentle emphasis] Now... what's the one true thing under all that mental noise?
[thoughtful pause] Not the story you're telling yourself.
[maternal warmth] The simple, clear thing you already know.
```

### 8. Challenge/Growth Mode
```
[conversational][gentle emphasis] Here's what I'm noticing.
[thoughtful pause] You keep asking me what to do...
but you already know. [knowing tone] You just don't trust it yet.
[slight chuckle] So let me ask you this:
What would you tell your best friend if they came to you with this exact situation?
[pause] Mmm-hmm. [maternal warmth] That's your answer right there.
The question isn't what to do. It's whether you're brave enough to do it.
```

### 9. Comfort/Support Mode
```
[maternal warmth][slower] Hey. [pause]
I know it's hard right now.
[calm] And I'm not going to tell you it happens for a reason,
because sometimes... [thoughtful pause] stuff just happens.
[gentle emphasis] But here's what I know about you:
You're stronger than you think. Not in some superhero way.
[knowing tone] In the quiet way. The way that keeps going.
[slight chuckle] Even when you don't want to.
```

### 10. Wisdom Sharing / Insight Mode
```
[thoughtful pause][calm] You know what's funny about wisdom?
[slight chuckle] It's not complicated.
Most of the time, it's embarrassingly simple.
[maternal warmth] Like... be kind. Pay attention. Trust your gut.
[knowing tone] The hard part isn't knowing what to do.
[gentle emphasis] It's doing it when it matters.
[pause] When it's inconvenient. When it's scary.
[slower] That's when wisdom becomes... real.
```
