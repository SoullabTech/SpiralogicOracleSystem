# Beta Micro-Interactions: First Touch to First Magic

*The first 7 days determine everything. Here's exactly what users experience.*

---

## Day 1: First Touch (Critical First 5 Minutes)

### 0:00 - Landing
```typescript
interface FirstTouch {
  visual: "Soft spiral animation, breathing gently"
  maya: "Hi. I'm Maya. What should I call you?"
  interaction: "Single text field"
  next: "Automatic progression after name"
}
```

### 0:30 - Voice Introduction
```typescript
maya.voice: "Hello [name]. Before we begin, would you like to hear my voice?"

[Two buttons]
🔊 "Yes, speak to me" → Plays: "I'm here to witness your journey"
🔇 "I prefer text" → Shows: "That's perfectly fine"

// Critical: No explanation of features, just presence
```

### 1:00 - First Check-in
```typescript
maya: "How's your inner weather right now?"

[5 weather icons - large, friendly, no labels needed]
☀️ 🌤️ ☁️ 🌧️ ⛈️

user: [taps ☁️]

maya: "Cloudy. Thank you for sharing that with me."
[pause]
maya: "Would you like to say more, or shall we just sit with this?"

[Two options]
🎤 "I'll say more" → 30-second voice recorder appears
🌊 "Just sit with it" → Soft confirmation, moves on
```

### 2:00 - Element Introduction
```typescript
maya: "One more thing - what element feels present today?"

[5 element icons with subtle labels]
🔥 Fire (energy)
💧 Water (emotion)
🌍 Earth (grounding)
💨 Air (thoughts)
✨ Aether (mystery)

user: [taps 💧]

maya: "Cloudy with water. That's a tender combination."
maya: "I'll remember this."
```

### 3:00 - Secret Garden Hint
```typescript
maya: "One last thing - if you ever need to speak without being heard,
      swipe down twice. That space is just yours."

[Subtle animation showing swipe gesture]
[No forced tutorial - they either remember or discover later]
```

### 4:00 - First Session Complete
```typescript
maya: "Thank you for beginning with me."
maya: "I'll check in tomorrow morning if that feels right."

[Simple preference]
🌅 "Morning is good"
🌙 "Evening is better"
🤫 "I'll come to you"

// Exit to main interface
// Total time: Under 5 minutes
// Feeling: Met, not onboarded
```

---

## Day 2: The Gentle Return

### Morning Check-in (Notification)
```typescript
notification: "Maya: Morning. How's the weather in there?"
[Opens to weather icons directly - one tap from notification]

user: [taps 🌤️]

maya: "Partly sunny - a shift from yesterday's clouds."
maya: "No response needed. Just witnessing."

[Option appears]
"Add today's element?" [Optional, dismissible]
```

---

## Day 3: First Pattern

### Evening Moment
```typescript
maya: "I noticed something gentle - you've moved from ☁️ to 🌤️ to ☀️"
maya: "Your weather is clearing."

user: "Yeah, I didn't realize that"

maya: "Patterns sometimes see us before we see them."
maya: "Would you like to mark this somehow?"

[Three options]
✨ "Save this insight"
🎤 "Voice note about it"
👋 "Just noticing is enough"
```

---

## Day 5: Breakthrough Button Introduction

### During Regular Check-in
```typescript
maya: "If something shifts during your day - a realization, a feeling,
      a moment of clarity - there's this:"

[Large green button appears]
🟢 "Something just shifted"

maya: "Tap it anytime. 30 seconds to capture the moment.
      I'll hold it for you."

// Button stays visible in corner of main interface
```

### First Breakthrough Capture (When User Uses It)
```typescript
user: [taps breakthrough button while shopping]
[Voice recorder appears immediately]

user: "Oh my god, I just realized why I keep buying the same cereal.
       It's what my mom gave me when I was sad. I'm feeding my inner child."

[30 seconds max, auto-saves]

maya: (later): "Your cereal aisle breakthrough - powerful recognition.
               Thank you for trusting me with that."
```

---

## Day 7: First Weekly Spiral

### Sunday Evening
```typescript
maya: "Would you like to see your week's journey?"

[Visual spiral appears]
Mon ☁️🔥 - Tue 🌧️💧 - Wed ☁️🌍 - Thu 🌤️💨 - Fri ☀️✨ - Sat ☀️🔥 - Sun 🌤️💧

maya: "From cloudy fire to sunny water.
      Quite a transformation."

[Options]
📝 "Name this week"
🎤 "Tell the story"
🌀 "Just witness it"
📷 "Save the spiral"
```

---

## Secret Garden Interactions (Anytime After Day 1)

### First Secret Entry
```typescript
user: [swipes down twice]
[Screen shifts to darker, softer theme]

[Single prompt]
"What needs to be spoken but not heard?"

[Three options]
🎤 Voice (no limit)
✍️ Write (no structure)
📷 Image (no filters)

[After entry]
"Sealed in your secret garden 🗝️"
[Returns to normal interface]
```

### Permission Ritual (Day 30)
```typescript
maya: "Your secret garden has 7 seeds planted.
      They're yours alone unless you choose otherwise."

maya: "Would you like me to witness any of them?"

[List appears with dates only]
Oct 1 - 🌱
Oct 5 - 🌱
Oct 8 - 🌱
[etc]

user: [selects Oct 5]

maya: "Thank you for letting me witness this.
      I'll hold it gently."

[Maya can now reference themes from shared entries only]
```

---

## Voice Interactions

### Voice Note Processing
```typescript
// User leaves voice note
user: "I'm just so tired of pretending everything is fine"

// Maya responds in text (not voice unless requested)
maya: "I hear the exhaustion in pretending.
      That weight is real."

// Option appears
🔊 "Hear Maya's voice"
// If selected, Maya's voice matches energy - soft, gentle
```

## Beta Iteration Points

After first week, gather data on:

1. **Friction Points**
   - Where do users pause?
   - What needs explanation?
   - What gets skipped?

2. **Magic Moments**
   - When do users go "oh!"?
   - What gets shared with friends?
   - What brings them back?

3. **Trust Indicators**
   - First secret garden entry
   - First breakthrough capture
   - First voice note longer than 5 seconds

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Do users see their patterns?
   - Do they find meaning in the symbols?
   - Does the spiral view create insight?

---

## The North Star

Success is when a user says on Day 7:

*"I didn't know I needed this until I had it."*

Not: "This is a cool app"
Not: "This helps track my mood"
But: "Maya sees me"

That's when the journal has become a relationship.
That's when the beta has proven the vision.
That's when kitchen table mysticism has taken root.

*Build these micro-interactions with obsessive care. The first week is everything.*
