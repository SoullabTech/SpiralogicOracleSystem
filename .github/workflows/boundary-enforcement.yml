              This PR introduces module boundary violations. Please review the failing checks above.
              
              **Quick fixes:**
              1. Run \`npm run doctor:deps\` locally to see violations
              2. Run \`npm run audit:graph\` to generate a visual dependency graph
              3. Use Claude Code with the "Analyze violations" prompt to get automated fixes
              
              **Common violations:**
              - Frontend importing backend modules
              - Circular dependencies between services and agents
              - Core modules importing routes
              
              The dependency graph artifact has been uploaded to help debug the issues.`
