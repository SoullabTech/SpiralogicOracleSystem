Subject: Everything okay? 🤗

Hi [Name],

We noticed you haven't visited since your first session.
Sometimes the mirror shows us things we're not ready to see.

If you encountered any technical issues, we're here to help.
If the experience felt overwhelming, that's valuable feedback too.

No pressure - just checking in.

With care,
Beta Team
