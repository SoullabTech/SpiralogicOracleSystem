# ðŸŒ¸ Ask Maya: Executive Summary

**Consciousness Technology for Digital-Native Mental Health**

## The Problem
**76% of Gen Z try mental health apps. 30% abandon them within a week.**

They don't need another meditation app. They need a **translator** that bridges:
- Their digital-native language ("I saw this TikTok about ADHD masking")
- Clinical wisdom and trauma-informed care
- Identity-affirming resources that actually work

**Current apps treat symptoms. Ask Maya translates consciousness.**
