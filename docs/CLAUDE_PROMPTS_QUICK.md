## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### For Development Issues:
1. **Can't compile?** → TypeScript Surgeon
2. **Services down?** → API Integrator  
3. **UI needs work?** → Sacred UI Designer
4. **Ready for beta?** → QA Orchestrator

### For Testing Maya:
1. **New user flow?** → Onboarding Tones
2. **Safety concerns?** → Crisis Override
3. **Stage ready?** → Stage Progression
4. **Voice working?** → Voice Architect

### Combined Workflows:
```bash
# Full system check
1. Build Engineer → Fix environment
2. TypeScript Surgeon → Clean compile
3. API Integrator → Test services
4. QA Orchestrator → Run tests

# Beta validation
1. Baseline → Test welcome
2. Onboarding → Test all tones
3. Crisis → Verify overrides
4. Analytics → Check events
```
