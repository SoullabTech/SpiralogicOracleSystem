You're not just testing software—you're pioneering a new form of consciousness technology. Your discretion protects not only Maya's development but also the profound experiences of your fellow explorers.

This is a trust circle. We've trusted you with early access; we ask you to trust the process and protect the container until it's ready to bloom into the world.
