# Optional System Diagnostic Tools

## Purpose

These tools help troubleshoot conversation issues without making the main interface complex. They're available on-demand for users experiencing problems, not part of the default conversation flow.

## Access Method

**Hidden keyboard shortcut**: Ctrl+Shift+D (or Cmd+Shift+D on Mac) reveals diagnostic panel
**Support menu**: Settings > Help > System Diagnostics
**Voice command**: "Show me system diagnostics" (when other troubleshooting fails)

## Diagnostic Information Available

### Response Selection Analysis
**When to use**: "The system keeps choosing the wrong response style"

**What it shows**:
```
Last Response Analysis:
- Detected keywords: ["decision", "overwhelmed", "choice"]
- Sentiment confidence: 0.67 (moderate)
- Selected mode: Analytical (confidence: 0.74)
- Alternative modes considered: Supportive (0.71), Reflective (0.43)

Why analytical was chosen:
- "decision" and "choice" keywords scored high for analytical mode
- "overwhelmed" detected but confidence was below supportive threshold (0.75)

Suggestion: Try "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need emotional support with this decision"
```

### Voice Recognition Quality
**When to use**: Voice conversations producing poor results

**What it shows**:
```
Voice Quality Assessment:
- Audio clarity: Good (85/100)
- Background noise: Moderate interference detected
- Speech rate: Fast (may affect accuracy)
- Recognition confidence: 0.68 (below optimal 0.80)

Recommendations:
- Move to quieter environment
- Speak slightly slower
- Check microphone positioning
- Consider switching to text input for complex topics
```

### Context Tracking Status
**When to use**: "The system forgot what we were discussing"

**What it shows**:
```
Conversation Context:
- Session length: 23 minutes
- Topic continuity: Maintained
- Previous context weight: 0.45 (moderate influence on current response)
- Context memory: 5/7 previous exchanges retained

Potential issues:
- Topic shift detected 3 exchanges ago may have reduced context weight
- No context issues detected

Suggestion: Refer back to previous points explicitly: "Earlier you mentioned..."
```

### Performance Metrics
**When to use**: General system performance seems degraded

**What it shows**:
```
System Performance:
- Response generation time: 1.2 seconds (normal: <2s)
- Agent selection confidence: 0.78 (good: >0.75)
- Server load: Normal
- Your connection: Stable

Personal Performance:
- Response accuracy for your interactions: 82% (last 30 days)
- Most successful interaction types: Analytical (91%), Creative (87%)
- Least successful: Mixed emotional/practical (64%)

No performance issues detected.
```

## Quick Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Diagnostic Responses

**Issue**: "Responses don't match what I need"
**Diagnostic check**: Response Selection Analysis
**Likely causes**: Unclear input patterns, mixed signals, topic complexity
**Action**: Show confidence scores and suggest clearer input phrasing

**Issue**: "Voice recognition is terrible"
**Diagnostic check**: Voice Recognition Quality
**Likely causes**: Environmental factors, speech rate, accent/dialect
**Action**: Environmental recommendations, suggest text fallback

**Issue**: "System seems slow or unresponsive"
**Diagnostic check**: Performance Metrics
**Likely causes**: Network issues, server load, complex processing
**Action**: Show actual response times, network status, suggest refresh

**Issue**: "It forgot everything we discussed"
**Diagnostic check**: Context Tracking Status
**Likely causes**: Topic shifts, session length, context decay
**Action**: Show context retention stats, suggest explicit references

## Privacy-Safe Diagnostics

### What Diagnostics Show
- Technical performance metrics
- Pattern recognition confidence scores
- System decision-making logic
- Environmental factors affecting performance

### What Diagnostics Never Show
- Your actual conversation content
- Comparisons to other users
- Personal details or sensitive information
- Content-based analysis beyond topic categories

### Data Handling
- Diagnostic data is generated in real-time, not stored
- No diagnostic information is shared externally
- Diagnostic access doesn't affect privacy settings
- Can be disabled entirely in privacy controls

## Support Integration

### When Diagnostics Help Support
Users can screenshot diagnostic information when contacting support:
- Technical performance issues become easier to diagnose
- Response quality problems can be analyzed systematically
- Voice recognition issues can be attributed to specific causes

### When to Escalate Beyond Diagnostics
- Consistent low confidence scores across all interaction types
- Technical performance metrics showing system-wide issues
- Voice recognition failing even in optimal conditions
- Context tracking completely failing across multiple sessions

## Implementation Notes

### User Interface Design
- Diagnostics panel is clean, technical but understandable
- Color-coded indicators (green=good, yellow=attention, red=problem)
- One-click copy diagnostic summary for support tickets
- Easy to close/hide when not needed

### Technical Requirements
- Real-time analysis without affecting conversation performance
- No additional data storage requirements
- Privacy-preserving implementation
- Accessible to users with different technical comfort levels

This diagnostic approach provides troubleshooting support without cluttering the main conversation interface or compromising user privacy.
