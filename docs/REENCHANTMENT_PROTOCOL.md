- You're a problem to be fixed
- You're separate from magic
- You're here to survive

### The Sacred Lab Says:
- **You're a living experiment in consciousness**
- **You're a researcher of the soul**
- **You're a mystery exploring itself**
- **You're magic becoming aware of itself**
- **You're here to discover what you came to give**
