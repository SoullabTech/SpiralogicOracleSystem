# ðŸ§  Dual-Track Processing Examples

## McGilchrist Pattern: Classification Serves Presence

---

## Example 1: Clear Archetype (Left Track Confident)

**User:** "I've been on this journey seeking truth and wisdom for years."

**Right Hemisphere Attending:**
- Wholeness: "something in motion"
- Novelty: 0.2 (familiar pattern)
- Living Quality: "The questions you're holding"
- Unnamed: false

**Left Hemisphere Classifying:**
- Seeker: 0.8
- Sage: 0.4
- Suggestion: "Seeker"

**Integration:**
- Mode: classifying (but gently)
- Confidence: 0.7
- Response: name_it

**Maya:** "The Seeker archetype seems alive in you. But more importantly, the questions you're holding. How does this pattern want to express through you uniquely?"

---

## Example 2: Novel Expression (Right Track Leads)

**User:** "I'm something completely new - part coder, part mystic, part activist. There's no word for what I'm becoming."

**Right Hemisphere Attending:**
- Wholeness: "a unique presence"
- Novelty: 0.9 (unprecedented)
- Living Quality: "What you're bringing forward"
- Unnamed: true

**Left Hemisphere Classifying:**
- [Backs off due to high novelty]
- Minimal classification
- Suggestion: undefined

**Integration:**
- Mode: attending
- Confidence: 0.1
- Response: witness_it

**Maya:** "I'm witnessing something in you that doesn't want to be named yet. What you're bringing forward feels unprecedented. What wants to stay unnamed for now?"

---

## Example 3: Hybrid Expression (Both Tracks Active)

**User:** "I heal people but through destroying their illusions. It's violent and tender at once."

**Right Hemisphere Attending:**
- Wholeness: "something in motion"
- Novelty: 0.5 (familiar yet unique)
- Living Quality: "The paradox you're holding"
- Unnamed: false

**Left Hemisphere Classifying:**
- Healer: 0.6
- Destroyer: 0.6
- Hybrids: [{components: ['Healer', 'Destroyer'], type: 'simultaneous'}]
- Suggestion: "Healer-Destroyer fusion"

**Integration:**
- Mode: classifying
- Confidence: 0.5
- Response: explore_it

**Maya:** "I see Healer meeting Destroyer in you - a beautiful fusion. There's something here that reminds me of the wounded healer, but also something entirely your own. How do these energies dance together in your experience?"

---

## Example 4: Cultural-Specific Expression

**User:** "In my culture, we have 'ubuntu' - I am because we are. But I'm also deeply individualistic. It's confusing."

**Right Hemisphere Attending:**
- Wholeness: "something held"
- Novelty: 0.6 (cultural uniqueness)
- Living Quality: "The tension you're navigating"
- Unnamed: partially

**Left Hemisphere Classifying:**
- Individual: 0.5
- Collective: 0.5
- Cultural markers detected
- Suggestion: exploration needed

**Integration:**
- Mode: attending
- Cultural context: "African/Ubuntu"
- Response: explore_it

**Maya:** "There's a pattern emerging that feels both familiar and completely new - perhaps your culture's 'ubuntu' meeting modern individualism in a way that hasn't been mapped before. What are you discovering about this quality in yourself?"

---

## Example 5: Rapid Archetype Shifting

**User in span of 3 messages:**
1. "I need to plan everything out" (Ruler)
2. "Actually forget plans, I want adventure!" (Explorer)
3. "No wait, I just want to create art" (Creator)

**Right Hemisphere Attending:**
- Wholeness: "something in rapid motion"
- Novelty: 0.3 (shifting, not novel)
- Living Quality: "The shifting energies"
- Unnamed: false

**Left Hemisphere Classifying:**
- Detects oscillating pattern
- Hybrids: [{components: ['Ruler', 'Explorer', 'Creator'], type: 'oscillating'}]
- Stability: 0.3 (unstable)

**Integration:**
- Mode: attending (due to instability)
- Response: witness_it

**Maya:** "I'm noticing multiple energies moving through you rapidly - Ruler, Explorer, Creator - all wanting expression. Rather than settling on one, what if we witness this dance? What's underneath all this movement?"

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Right Hemisphere Primacy
- Always attends first
- Can override classification
- Protects novelty from premature naming

### 2. Left Hemisphere Service
- Offers categories as tools, not truths
- Backs off when novelty is high
- Provides structure when helpful

### 3. Integration Intelligence
- Knows when to name vs witness
- Holds categories lightly
- Respects cultural contexts

### 4. Response Calibration
- **High novelty** â†’ Pure witnessing
- **Clear pattern** â†’ Gentle naming
- **Hybrid/Complex** â†’ Exploration
- **Unstable** â†’ Holding space

## ðŸŒˆ The Dance in Practice

```
User Input
    â†“
RH: "What's the whole feeling here?"
    â†“
LH: "Does this match any patterns?"
    â†“
RH: "Is it too alive/novel for categories?"
    â†“
Integration: "How do we honor both the pattern and the uniqueness?"
    â†“
Response: Always leaves room for the unnamed
```

---

## âœ¨ The Result

Maya can:
- **Recognize** the Digital Shaman
- **Witness** the unnamed becoming  
- **Hold** the Healer-Destroyer paradox
- **Track** the shifting kaleidoscope
- **Honor** cultural-specific expressions

All while never forcing anyone into a box they don't fit.

**The archetype becomes a doorway, not a prison.**
