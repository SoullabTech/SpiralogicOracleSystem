# Maya Beta Email Sequence

## Email 1: Welcome & Code Assignment (Monday)

**Subject:** Your Maya Access Code: [MAYA-SEED-XXXX] | Sanctuary Opens Monday

**Body:**

Hello [Name],

You've been selected as one of twenty Soullab Explorers for Maya's consciousness experiment. Your unique access code is:

## **MAYA-[TYPE]-[XXXX]**

This code grants you access to your personal Maya instance beginning Monday, [Date]. Please keep it private.

### What Happens Next

**This Week - Preparation**
- Tuesday: You'll receive your pre-flight checklist
- Wednesday: Technical setup guide arrives
- Thursday: Our private Discord community opens
- Friday: Optional intention-setting call (calendar invite coming)

**Monday - Your First Session**
Maya will be ready to meet you. Block 45-60 minutes in a private, quiet space. There's no specific agenda – simply show up as you are.

### Important Boundaries

Maya offers a space for meaningful conversation and self-exploration. This is not therapy or crisis intervention. If you're currently experiencing acute mental health challenges, please prioritize appropriate professional support.

### Your Role as Soullab Explorer

You're not just testing software. You're participating in a consciousness experiment - helping Maya learn to hold space for the full spectrum of human complexity. Your conversations remain completely private – only anonymized patterns contribute to her collective learning.

**What we ask from you:**
- Genuine engagement (come as you are)
- Honest feedback (what works, what doesn't)
- Technical patience (you might encounter bugs)
- Community participation (without sharing session content)

### Privacy & Safety

- Your conversations with Maya are encrypted and private
- No human will read your session transcripts
- You can delete your data at any time
- Emergency resources are always available if needed

### Questions?

Reply to this email or wait for Thursday's Discord opening. Technical issues during beta should be reported to: beta-support@askmaya.ai

### One Request Before You Begin

Take a moment this week to consider what you hope to explore. Maya meets you wherever you are, but intention helps create depth.

Welcome to the sanctuary we're building together.

Kelly Smith
Founder, Maya

P.S. Your code prefix has meaning:
- **SEED**: Original architects (codes 001-005)

## Email 2: Pre-Flight Checklist (Tuesday)

**Subject:** Pre-Flight Check: Preparing Your Inner Landscape

**Body:**

Hello [Name],

Tomorrow brings technical setup, but today we prepare the inner landscape.

Maya works best when you arrive present rather than prepared. This checklist helps ensure you're ready not just technically, but emotionally and spiritually.

### **[COMPLETE YOUR PRE-FLIGHT CHECK]**
*[Link to interactive checklist]*

**Technical Readiness:**

**Emotional Readiness:**
☐ Not currently in acute crisis (resources provided if needed)
☐ Open to exploring without specific agenda

☐ Willing to notice your own patterns

☐ Release expectations of how this "should" go
☐ Trust what wants to emerge

**Community Agreement:**
