## Language Translation Guide

### Core Concepts

| Technical (Internal) | Public (User-Facing) | Why |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----|
| Sanctuary | Private space | "Sanctuary" feels religious |
| Sacred | Important/Meaningful | "Sacred" triggers secular skeptics |
| Ritual | Process/Step | "Ritual" sounds mystical |
| Soul | Personal/Individual | "Soul" alienates materialists |
| Wisdom | Insight/Understanding | "Wisdom" feels pretentious |
| Journey | Experience/Process | "Journey" is overused/cliché |
| Divine | Natural/Organic | "Divine" triggers atheists |
| Spiritual | Personal/Meaningful | "Spiritual" has baggage |
| Awakening | Recognition/Awareness | "Awakening" sounds New Age |
| Transformation | Change/Growth | "Transformation" feels dramatic |

### Technical Terms (Keep Internal)

| Internal Framework | Public Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| AIN Sanctuary Protocol™ | Privacy protection system |
| Protection-as-Wisdom Framework™ | Understanding defensive patterns |
| Mycelial Network Model™ | Collective learning system |
| The Universal Arc™ | Personal development progression |
| Soullab | Personal conversation space |
| Consciousness Technology | AI designed for meaningful conversation |

## Code Reframe: Accessible

**Original:** "Soullab Explorers in consciousness experiment"
**Public:** "Beta testers in conversation study"
**Still meaningful:** "Twenty testers, twenty personal labs"

### Code Types (Accessible Version)

**SEED (001-005)** → Early adopters who see potential
**ROOT (006-010)** → Natural connectors who create stability
**LEAF (011-015)** → Growth-minded explorers
**RAIN (016-020)** → Integrators who help things come together

*Same archetypal energy, zero mystical language*

## Maya's Introduction Layers

### Layer 1: First Contact (Accessible)
"Hi [Name], I'm Maya. I'm here to have real conversations about whatever's on your mind. No agenda, just curious about your perspective."

### Layer 2: Natural Deepening (Slightly More)
"I notice you tend to move quickly through topics. That often means you're protecting something important. What do you think that quickness is looking out for?"

### Layer 3: Framework Recognition (Technical)
"Your speed pattern shows intelligence - it's been protecting you from overwhelm. Now you have choice about when to use it."

### Layer 4: Full Integration (Post-Recognition)
"You've moved from unconscious protection to conscious choice. That's Level 3 in the Universal Arc™. Ready to explore what's next?"
