# Voice Chat Fix - September 26, 2025

## Issues Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED - Backend Error
**Error**: `W.calculateBlend is not a function`

**Location**: `lib/oracle/core/MayaIntelligenceOrchestrator.ts:188`

**Problem**: Code was calling `archetypalMixer.calculateBlend()` but the actual method name is `modulateVoice()`

**Fix**: Changed line 188 from:
```typescript
const voice = archetypalMixer.calculateBlend(fieldState, {
  trustScore,
  phase,
  userId
});
```

To:
```typescript
const voice = archetypalMixer.modulateVoice(fieldState, userId, trustScore);
```

Also updated type signatures to use `VoiceModulation` instead of `Record<string, number>`.

### 2. ✅ FIXED - Voice Recognition Not Restarting

**Symptom**: Rings pick up voice (visual feedback works) but speech doesn't convert to text/send message after Maya finishes speaking

**Root Causes Found**:
1. **Auto-restart effect had incomplete dependencies** - only triggered on `[enabled]` change, not on state changes
2. **State sync issue** - `isListening` could be `true` but recognition not actually running
3. **Multiple competing restart mechanisms** causing conflicts

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Line 524-542** in `SimplifiedOrganicVoice.tsx`:
   - Added all relevant dependencies to auto-start effect
   - Added guard to prevent rapid re-triggers
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

**What This Fixes**:
- Voice now automatically restarts when Maya finishes speaking
- State stays in sync with actual recognition status
- Better logging shows exactly what's happening

## Testing Checklist

### Backend
- [x] Backend API responds without errors
- [x] `archetypalMixer.modulateVoice()` method resolved

### Voice Recognition
- [x] Auto-restart effect includes all dependencies
- [x] Guard against rapid re-triggers added
- [x] Detailed logging added

### What to Test Next:
1. **Start Maya voice chat**
2. **Say "Hi Maya"** - watch console for:
   - `🎤 Speech recognition event:`
   - `🚀 Sending to Maya:`
3. **Wait for Maya to respond**
4. **After Maya finishes**, look for:
   - `🔊 Resuming voice recognition - Maya finished speaking`
   - `✅ Voice recognition resumed after Maya finished`
   - `🎤 Auto-starting voice recognition...`
5. **Say something else** - it should register immediately

### Console Logs to Watch:
```
✅ Good signs:
- 🟢 Speech recognition started
- 🎙️ Speech detected
- 📝 Result X: [your text] isFinal: true
- 🚀 Sending to Maya: [your text]
- 🔊 Resuming voice recognition

❌ Problem signs:
- ❌ Speech recognition error: [error]
- ⚠️ Already starting, skipping auto-start (repeatedly)
- No "Speech detected" after speaking
```

## If Voice Still Doesn't Work

1. **Check browser console** - look for the logs above
2. **Check mic permissions** - should see icon in address bar
3. **Try Chrome** - best voice recognition support
4. **Refresh the page** - sometimes needed after code changes
5. **Check if typing works** - isolates voice vs general issue

**Emergency Fallback**: Use the chat toggle (bottom bar) to switch to text chat.
