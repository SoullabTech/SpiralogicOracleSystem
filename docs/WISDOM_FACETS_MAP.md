# Wisdom Facets Mapping

**Spiralogic as the loom where different wisdom threads are woven together.**

Each facet is a lens into human experience‚Äînot competing frameworks, but complementary mirrors that reflect different aspects of consciousness.

## How to Use This Map

**Spiralogic doesn't prescribe which lens to use.** Instead:

1. **Notice what's alive:** Which element is activated? Which phase feels resonant?
2. **Let the facets emerge:** The system surfaces voices that clarify your current experience
3. **Follow what resonates:** Sometimes one voice; sometimes many at once
4. **Trust the weaving:** All perspectives are threads in your larger becoming

**The invitation:** Not to master all lenses, but to let the right mirror find you at the right time.
