    eveningReflection: "What are you grateful for from today?";
  };

  // Elemental prompts
  elemental: {
    fire: ["What's ready to transform?", "Where do you feel most alive?", "What bold truth wants to be spoken?"];
    water: ["What emotions are moving through you?", "Where do you need more flow?", "What does your intuition know?"];
    earth: ["What feels solid and supportive?", "How is your body today?", "What practical step serves you?"];
    air: ["What thoughts are circling?", "What needs to be communicated?", "Where do you seek clarity?"];
    aether: ["What feels meaningful right now?", "How do you connect to purpose?", "What feels sacred?"];
  };

  // Creative alternatives
  alternative: {
    dialogue: "Write a conversation with [specific person/part of self]";
    letter: "Write a letter you'll never send to...";

    stream: "Just write whatever comes, no editing";
    voice: "Speak what you can't write";
  };
}
```

**Intelligent Response System**
```typescript
interface JournalResponse {
  // Reflection patterns
  mirroring: {
    pattern: "I notice you mentioned [theme] several times...";

    validation: "That resonates as really important";
  };

  // Deepening invitations
  exploration: {
    elemental: "Would you like to explore this through your [element] lens?";
    archetypal: "What would the [archetype] in you say about this?";
    somatic: "How does this feel in your body?";
    temporal: "How has this theme evolved for you?";
  };

  // Integration support
  synthesis: {
    pattern: "This connects to what you wrote about [previous theme]";
