□ /api/safety/process - Safety pipeline active
□ /api/oracle/journal/upload - Journal integration works
```

**Test Script:**
```typescript
// Quick test - Run this to verify core systems
async function testBetaSystems() {
  console.log('🔍 Testing MAIA Beta Systems for 09/29/25 Launch...\n');

  // Test 1: MAIA Response with Preferences
  const maiaTest = await fetch('/api/oracle/personal', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      input: 'Hello MAIA',
      userId: 'test_user_beta',
      preferences: {
        communicationStyle: 'gentle',
        explorationDepth: 'moderate',
        practiceOpenness: true,
        tone: 0.3,
        style: 'prose'
      }
    })
  });
  console.log('✅ MAIA Response:', maiaTest.ok ? 'WORKING' : 'FAILED');

  // Test 2: Safety System
  const safetyTest = await fetch('/api/safety/process', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId: 'test_user_beta',
      message: 'feeling overwhelmed',
      riskLevel: 'low'
    })
  });
  console.log('✅ Safety System:', safetyTest.ok ? 'WORKING' : 'FAILED');

  // Test 3: Beta Monitoring
  const monitoringTest = await fetch('/api/beta/reports');
  console.log('✅ Beta Monitoring:', monitoringTest.ok ? 'WORKING' : 'FAILED');
