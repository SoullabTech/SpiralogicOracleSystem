# üåÄ 7-Day Spiralogic Beta Journey

## Core Philosophy: Container + Emergence
- **Structure without forcing**: Clear arc but with skip/adapt options at every step
- **Depth without overwhelm**: 10-20 minute daily commitment with optional expansion
- **Learning rhythm**: Each day teaches MAIA about the user's natural patterns

## Daily Arc Structure

### **Day 1 (Monday) - Fire/Initiation üî•**

## Week-End Beta Feedback (Sunday Evening)

- "What would make next week even better?"

**Optional Deeper Feedback**:
- Voice note to MAIA team
- "What surprised you about this experience?"
- "Which day felt most/least helpful?"

## Adaptation Logic for Week 2

```typescript
interface WeekTwoAdaptation {
  // If engagement was low (< 5 min average)
  minimalist: {
    shorterPrompts: true,
    skipArchetypalChat: optional,
    focusOnJournaling: true
  };

  // If user requested more depth
  expanded: {
    secondArchetypeOption: true,
    longerIntegrationPractices: true,
    optionalBonusPrompts: true
  };

  // If user struggled with shadow work
  gentleApproach: {
    replaceDay6WithJoy: true,
    addSafetyReminders: true,
    offerGroundingMore: true
  };

  // If user loved creative expression
  artisticFocus: {
    addVisualJournaling: true,
    creativeIntegrations: true,
    imageUploadOption: true
  };
}
```

## Critical Refinements for Beta Success

### 1. **Immediate Reflection of Onboarding Choices**
```typescript
// First interaction after onboarding
if (userStyle === 'gentle') {
  firstMessage = "I'm here to explore gently with you. What's alive in your heart today?"
} else if (userStyle === 'direct') {
  firstMessage = "Let's dive in. What's really on your mind right now?"
}
```

### 2. **Chat ‚Üî Journal Context Options**
```typescript
interface ContextTransfer {
  user_choice: 'summary' | 'direct_quote' | 'themes_only';

  summary: "MAIA and I discussed your relationship challenges...";
  direct_quote: "You said: 'I feel stuck between wanting connection and needing space'...";
  themes_only: "Themes from our chat: boundaries, connection, self-care...";
}
```

### 3. **Friction Monitoring Points**
- **Skip rates** by day and element
- **Session completion time** vs optimal 10-20 minutes
- **Depth engagement** (surface vs meaningful responses)
- **Practice completion** for integration cues
- **Safety system activation** frequency and user response

### 4. **Success Metrics Refined**
- **Completion**: 70% finish at least 5/7 days
- **Retention**: 80% active through Week 4
- **Depth**: 50% engage meaningfully with shadow/integration work
- **Satisfaction**: Daily ratings average >7/10
- **Growth**: Each user reports 2+ significant insights
- **Safety**: Zero adverse events, high trust ratings

### 5. **Reserved Features for Post-Beta**
- Community sharing (too complex for 20 users)
- Dream capture (nice-to-have, not core)
- Biometric integration (add complexity)
- Advanced archetypal work (wait for user readiness)
- Astrological/tarot layers (avoid feature creep)

## Implementation Notes

### **Week 1**: Core rhythm establishment
- Focus on basic chat/journal flow
- Learn user patterns and preferences
- Establish safety and trust

### **Week 2**: Personalized adaptation
- Adjust based on Week 1 learnings
- Introduce user choice in rhythm
- Refine prompt difficulty/depth

### **Week 3**: Exploration expansion
- User can modify elemental sequence
- Optional bonus features based on interest
- Deeper integration of breakthrough patterns

### **Week 4**: Autonomy and graduation
- User designs their own rhythm
- MAIA becomes fully personalized
- Preparation for broader launch

This arc respects both the need for structure (giving testers a meaningful journey) and emergence (allowing natural development of each person's unique relationship with MAIA). The key is maintaining the container while never forcing the content.

The safety considerations around Day 6 (Shadow work) are particularly important - we want to honor depth without creating overwhelm, especially in a beta testing environment where people are also evaluating the system itself.
