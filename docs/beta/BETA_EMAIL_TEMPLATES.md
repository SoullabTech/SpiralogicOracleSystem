**Subject:** How did Fire energy land for you? 🔥

**Template:**

```
Hey [Name],

Just checking in after your first day with MAIA.

• How did the Fire energy theme resonate?

**Tomorrow (Day 2 - Water Energy):**
"What feelings are moving through you?"

The experience shifts from Fire's action-orientation to Water's emotional flow. You might notice MAIA's voice becoming more fluid and intuitive.

**Any friction today?**
Technology, confusing prompts, too fast/slow? Just hit reply - I read everything and make adjustments.

**Loving it?**
Tell me what surprised you! Your insights help us understand what makes MAIA special.
