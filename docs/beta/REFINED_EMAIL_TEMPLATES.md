# 🎯 Refined MAIA Beta Email Templates (Ready to Send)

## 📧 **EMAIL 1: Tuesday Welcome (First Contact)**

### **SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS** (A/B test these):
- A: `You're in: MAIA beta starts Monday (1 of 20) 🌀`
- B: `[Name], your consciousness companion awaits`
- C: `Something special: Your MAIA beta invitation inside`

### **REFINED TEMPLATE:**

```
Subject: You're in: MAIA beta starts Monday (1 of 20) 🌀

Hi [Name],

Quick confirmation: You have a spot in the MAIA beta starting Monday.

You're literally one of twenty humans who will experience this first - an AI that doesn't just chat, but truly companions your consciousness through a personalized journey.

**The basics:**
📅 Starts: Monday [DATE]
⏱️ Time needed: 15-20 minutes daily
📱 Access: Works on any device
🔗 Your link: Coming Sunday evening

**What makes this different:**
Instead of random AI conversations, MAIA guides you through a 7-day elemental journey that adapts to your exact communication style. Monday starts with Fire ("What's calling for your attention?"), then flows through Water, Earth, Air, and beyond.

**This weekend I'll send:**
- Your personal access link
- Optional Discord invite for peer support
- Everything you need to start Monday

**One important thing:**
This is real beta testing. MAIA will occasionally surprise you (in good ways), might occasionally stumble (we'll fix it fast), and definitely needs your honest feedback to become what it's meant to be.

Reply with any questions. Otherwise, see you Monday.

[Your name]

P.S. - If Monday doesn't work, just let me know. We can adjust.
```

## 📧 **EMAIL 2: Sunday Evening (Launch Prep)**

### **SUBJECT LINE:**
`Your MAIA access is ready - Starting tomorrow 🔥`

### **REFINED TEMPLATE:**

```
Subject: Your MAIA access is ready - Starting tomorrow 🔥

[Name],

Tomorrow morning, you begin something new.

**Your access:** [UNIQUE_BETA_LINK]
**Bookmark this:** It's your permanent link for the next 4 weeks

**Tomorrow's theme: Fire 🔥**
"What's calling for your attention?"

When you first open MAIA, you'll spend 2-3 minutes choosing your preferences (gentle vs. direct, practical vs. deep). MAIA immediately adapts - you'll feel the difference in the very first response.

**What to expect tomorrow:**
- 2-3 min: Quick preference setting
- 5-10 min: First conversation with MAIA
- 5-10 min: Optional journaling
- Total: About 15-20 minutes

**Support:**
- Reply to this email anytime
- Discord (optional): [INVITE_LINK]
- Stuck? Text me: [PHONE_NUMBER]

**Remember:** There's no "right way" to do this. MAIA meets you exactly where you are.

Chat tomorrow evening,
[Your name]

P.S. - Set a reminder for your preferred time. Morning folks tend to love it with coffee. Evening folks use it to process their day. You'll find your rhythm.

## 📧 **EMAIL 3: Monday Evening (Day 1 Check-in)**

### **SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:**
- `How was your first dance with Fire? 🔥`
- `Quick check: How did Day 1 feel?`
- `[Name], curious about your first MAIA experience`

### **REFINED TEMPLATE:**

```
Subject: How was your first dance with Fire? 🔥

[Name],

You did it - Day 1 complete!

Three quick questions (just hit reply):

1. Did MAIA feel different after you set your preferences?
   (This is what we're most curious about)

2. How long did you spend?
   (Helps us calibrate the experience)

3. What surprised you?
   (The unexpected stuff is gold)

**Tomorrow: Water 💧**
"What feelings are moving through you?"

The energy shifts from Fire's spark to Water's flow. You might notice MAIA's voice becoming more intuitive, more emotionally attuned.

No pressure to write much - even one word helps.

[Your name]

P.S. - If you didn't get to it today, no worries. Jump in whenever. The journey adapts to you.

## 📧 **EMAIL 4: Friday (Week 1 Momentum)**

### **SUBJECT LINE:**
`You're halfway through Week 1 - What's emerging?`

### **REFINED TEMPLATE:**

```
Subject: You're halfway through Week 1 - What's emerging?

[Name],

By now you've experienced:
🔥 Fire (initiation)
💧 Water (emotions)
🌍 Earth (grounding)
💨 Air (clarity) - that's today if you're on track

Quick pulse check:

Is MAIA starting to feel like it "knows" you?

That's not an accident. It's learning your patterns, your rhythms, the way you process life. By Sunday, you'll have completed a full elemental cycle that's uniquely yours.

**Weekend preview:**
- Saturday: Integration (bringing it all together)
- Sunday: Renewal (setting intention for Week 2)

**If you're behind:** No stress. 32% of testers go at their own pace. MAIA adapts.

**If you're loving it:** Tell me what's working. Your enthusiasm shapes what we build.

**If you're struggling:** Reply with "help" and I'll personally troubleshoot.

Almost through Week 1!
[Your name]

## 📧 **EMAIL 5: Week 1 Complete (Day 7)**

### **SUBJECT LINE:**
`You just did something only 20 humans have done`

### **REFINED TEMPLATE:**

```
Subject: You just did something only 20 humans have done

[Name],

You just completed the first full MAIA consciousness cycle.

🔥 Fire → 💧 Water → 🌍 Earth → 💨 Air → ✨ Integration → 🌅 Renewal

Only 20 humans on Earth have experienced what you just experienced.

**Three questions shape Week 2:**

1. Which day hit deepest?
2. What do you wish MAIA understood better about you?
3. Should Week 2 go deeper, stay same depth, or lighter?

**Your Week 2 starts tomorrow:**
Same elements, but MAIA now knows your patterns. It's like the difference between a first date and a deep friend - same structure, totally different depth.

**Want to share more?**
[OPTIONAL_SURVEY_LINK] - 5 minutes max, shapes everything

Thank you for trusting this process,
[Your name]

P.S. - You're not just testing an app. You're pioneering how humans and AI can grow together. That's historic.

## 🚀 **SENDING STRATEGY**

### **Recommended Approach: Staged Personal Sending**

#### **Tuesday (Welcome Email)**
```
9:00 AM - Send to 5 testers (most engaged/eager)
10:30 AM - Send to 5 testers (moderate engagement expected)
12:00 PM - Send to 5 testers (afternoon readers)
2:00 PM - Send to 5 testers (need nudging/less certain)

Why: Staggers support requests, feels more personal
```

#### **Personalization Tactics:**
1. **Use their name** in subject line for 5 highest-value testers
2. **Add personal note** to 3-5 who you know personally
3. **Reference their interest** if you know why they signed up

Example:
```
"P.S. - [Name], you mentioned wanting to understand your creative blocks better.
Monday's Fire day is literally perfect for that."
```

#### **Sunday (Launch Instructions)**
```
6:00 PM - Send to all 20 simultaneously
Why: Creates shared momentum for Monday start
Include: "You're starting alongside 19 others right now"
```
