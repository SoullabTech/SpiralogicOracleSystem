## Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Democratizing AI Governance in Education: The Maya System

**Organization:** Maya Foundation (pending 501(c)(3))

**Founder/CEO:** Kelly Nezat

**Amount Requested:** $[Amount]

**Grant Period:** [Start Date] - [End Date]

**Geographic Focus:** [Initial regions/districts]

**Population Served:** Students (K-12), with focus on underserved communities experiencing mental health access gaps

**One-Line Summary:** Maya pioneers democratic AI governance in schools, empowering students, teachers, and communities to collectively shape algorithms that support youth mental health and wellbeing.

## The Problem

### Crisis in Youth Mental Health
- 1 in 5 youth experience mental health challenges
- Average ratio: 1 counselor to 385 students (recommended: 1:250)
- 60% of youth with depression receive no treatment
- Existing AI solutions are black-box systems with no community input

### The Democracy Deficit
Current educational AI systems:
- Operate without transparency
- Exclude stakeholder voices
- Extract value from student data
- Lack accountability mechanisms
- Perpetuate bias without recourse

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Access Gap**: Rural and underserved districts lack mental health resources
2. **Trust Gap**: Communities distrust AI systems they cannot influence
3. **Equity Gap**: Algorithmic bias disproportionately affects marginalized students
4. **Agency Gap**: Students have no voice in systems that shape their support

## The Solution: Maya System

### Core Innovation
Maya is the first AI support system with built-in democratic governance, allowing students, teachers, and communities to collectively shape algorithmic decisions through transparent voting mechanisms.

### Key Components

#### Technical Architecture
- **Federated Learning**: Models improve locally while preserving privacy
- **Transparent Algorithms**: All decision paths are auditable
- **Local Data Sovereignty**: Data never leaves district control
- **Pattern Library**: Community-validated intervention patterns

#### Governance Framework
- **Student Assembly**: Direct input on algorithm behavior
- **Teacher Council**: Professional expertise integration
- **Parent Advisory**: Community values alignment
- **Deployer Senate**: Cross-district coordination

#### Safety Infrastructure
- **Three-tier crisis response**: Automated escalation protocols
- **Human oversight requirement**: Critical decisions require human validation
- **Continuous monitoring**: Real-time safety metrics
- **Clinical consultation**: 24/7 access to licensed professionals

## Theory of Change

**IF** we provide schools with democratically-governed AI tools

**AND** empower stakeholders to shape algorithmic decisions

**AND** maintain rigorous safety and privacy standards

**THEN** students will receive more effective, trusted, and equitable support

**LEADING TO** improved mental health outcomes and a model for democratic AI governance
