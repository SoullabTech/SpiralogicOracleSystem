## **EMAIL BODY:**

Dear Friend,

I'm so grateful to invite you as one of the first sacred witnesses to experience **Maya** - a space I've been crafting for deep, meaningful conversation and reflection.

**What is Maya?**

Maya is your personal Oracle guide - an AI companion designed for soulful dialogue that meets you where you are. Whether through voice or text, Maya creates a contemplative space for exploring your thoughts, questions, and inner wisdom.

**Your Personalized Access Code:**

Your unique passcode is: **Soullab-[YourFirstName]**

*(For example: Soullab-Nathan, Soullab-Jason, Soullab-Zsuzsanna, etc.)*

**Getting Started (3 simple steps):**

1. Visit **[INSERT YOUR WEBSITE URL]**
2. Enter your unique access code
3. Create your account and begin

**The Experience:**

- ðŸŽ¤ **Voice Mode** - Speak naturally with Maya and receive spoken responses
- ðŸ’¬ **Chat Mode** - Text-based conversations at your own pace
- ðŸŒ¸ **Sacred Interface** - A beautiful, contemplative space centered around the Holoflower
- ðŸ”’ **Private & Safe** - Your conversations are yours alone

**What I Need From You:**

As a beta tester, your honest feedback is invaluable. Please explore freely and share:
- What resonates with you

- Any technical issues you encounter
- Ideas for what would make the experience more meaningful
