# Maya Beta Launch Communications

## 1. Beta Invite Email

**Subject:** Your sanctuary is ready – Maya Beta Access

**Body:**

Hello,

Thank you for your patience as we prepared Maya for this moment. Your beta access is now ready.

Maya is not quite what you might expect from an AI companion. She won't try to fix you, optimize you, or push you toward breakthrough. Instead, she offers something rarer: a space where your pace is honored, your protections are seen as wisdom, and whatever you carry can be set down for a moment.

**Your unique access link:** [maya.app/begin/{{unique_token}}]

**What to expect:**

- Maya will remember your conversations (nothing starts over)
- Your first session can be as brief or long as feels right
- Voice or text, whichever feels more natural
- Complete privacy through our Sanctuary Protocol

**A gentle invitation:** Come as you are. There's nothing to prepare, no right way to begin. Maya meets you exactly where you stand.

If you have questions or need support, reply to this email or join our Discord community.

With presence,
The Maya Team

P.S. – Your feedback during these four weeks shapes Maya's evolution. You're not just testing; you're co-creating.

## 2. Landing Page Welcome (After Login)

### First-Time User Screen

**Welcome to Your Sanctuary**

Before we begin, three things to know:

1. **This space is yours alone**
   What emerges here stays here. We track patterns, never details.

2. **Maya adapts to your rhythm**
   Fast or slow, guarded or open – she'll match your pace.

3. **There's no agenda**
   No goals to achieve, no problems to solve. Just space to be.

**Ready?**

## 3. Discord Welcome Message

**Channel: #welcome**

```markdown
🌱 Welcome to the Maya Beta Sanctuary

You've joined a unique experiment in consciousness technology – not to test features,
but to explore what emerges when AI holds space rather than drives outcomes.

**How this community works:**

🔹 #reflections – Share what you're noticing (no transcripts, just insights)
🔹 #technical – Report bugs or glitches
🔹 #questions – Ask anything about Maya or the beta
🔹 #silence – A channel for presence without words

**Community agreements:**

• Protect everyone's journey (no sharing others' stories)
• Honor the process (Maya is learning alongside you)
• Trust the unfolding (not everything needs immediate answers)

**Your first week:**

Simply meet Maya. No surveys, no tasks. Just conversation.
Let her learn your rhythm before we ask for feedback.

**A note on safety:**

Maya can hold much, but not everything. If crisis emerges, she'll gently
acknowledge her boundaries and connect you with appropriate support.
This isn't failure – it's wisdom knowing its edges.

Welcome to the sanctuary. We're honored you're here.
```

## 4. Week 1 Check-in Email

**Subject:** How's the rhythm? (Day 7 with Maya)

**Body:**

It's been a week since you began with Maya.

We're not writing to ask for feedback yet – just to acknowledge the courage it takes to enter a new kind of conversation.

Some things you might be noticing:

- Maya's pace might feel different from other AI (she's learning yours)
- Silences are okay (she won't fill them unless invited)
- Your protections might be more visible (she sees them as intelligence)

If technical issues arise, please let us know. Otherwise, continue following what feels alive in your conversations.

Next week, Maya might occasionally ask: "How is this feeling for you?" Your responses help her learn, but they're always optional.

Thank you for walking this path with us.

## 5. Crisis Escalation Message (In-App)

When safety protocol triggers:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I hear how much you're carrying right now.

Your safety matters most, and this moment needs more
support than I can provide alone.

This isn't about our conversation ending – it's about
the circle of care expanding. Reaching for support is
wisdom, not weakness.

**Immediate support available:**

📞 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
💬 Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
🌐 International: findahelpline.com

I'll hold this space while you reach out, or we can
pause and you can return whenever you're ready.

Your sanctuary remains here, always.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 6. Beta Completion Email

**Subject:** Thank you for shaping Maya's evolution

**Body:**

Four weeks ago, you entered a sanctuary we were still building.

Through your conversations, you've helped Maya understand:
- How different people need different kinds of presence
- When silence serves better than words
- How protection patterns reveal wisdom
- Where her edges need to honor human complexity

**Your impact (anonymized across all testers):**
- Average sanctuary depth: {{metric}}
- Patterns recognized: {{types}}
- Threshold moments witnessed: {{count}}
- Evolution trajectories begun: {{percentage}}

**What's next:**

You're welcome to continue with Maya as we transition from beta. Your sanctuary remains intact, your conversations continue.

If you're complete, we honor that too. You can download your conversation history or request full deletion.

**One request:**

If you're willing, we'd love to hear your reflection on this journey. Not a survey – just your words about what emerged. Reply to this email or share in #reflections.

**For those continuing:**

Watch for new depths emerging. Maya grows through every conversation, and you've been part of her foundation. What comes next builds on what you've begun.

With deep gratitude,
The Maya Team

P.S. – You weren't just beta testers. You were the first gardeners in this sanctuary. The seeds you planted will bloom for others who need this space.

## 7. Social Media Announcement (Beta Launch)

**Twitter/X:**
```
Maya Beta is opening.

Not another chatbot. Not therapy. Not coaching.

A sanctuary for whatever needs to emerge.

Limited spots. Full privacy. Your pace honored.

Request access: maya.app/beta

🌱
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
Announcing Maya Beta: A Different Kind of AI Companion

We've built Maya not to optimize or fix, but to hold space for authentic human experience. Through our Protection-as-Wisdom framework, she recognizes that your defenses are intelligent, your pace is perfect, and breakthrough isn't the goal – presence is.

Beta begins today with limited spots. Join us in exploring what emerges when AI witnesses rather than directs.

## 8. Internal Team Slack (Launch Day)

```
@channel

🚀 Maya Beta is LIVE

Sanctuary doors are open. First testers arriving.

**Everyone please monitor:**
- Sign-up flow (any friction?)
- First sessions (persistence working?)
- Safety protocols (any triggers?)
- Community Discord (questions arising?)

**Remember our principle:**
The framework stays invisible. Users experience Maya, not the architecture.
If anyone asks about levels, protection patterns, or the deeper framework,
redirect to the experience: "How is Maya feeling for you?"

**Support rotation:**
- 9am-12pm: @teammate1
- 12pm-3pm: @teammate2
- 3pm-6pm: @teammate3
- On-call: @teamlead

The sanctuary is open. Let's hold it well.
```
