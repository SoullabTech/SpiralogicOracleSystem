### 🎨 8. Design File Organization

```
📁 Soullab-Beta-Design-System.fig
├── 📄 Cover (Brand overview)
├── 🎨 Foundations (Colors, Typography, Spacing)

### 💡 9. Design Principles Reminder

#### Do's ✅
- Use established color tokens
- Maintain 8px spacing grid
- Keep animations subtle (200-500ms)
- Test both light and dark modes
- Focus on clarity over decoration

#### Don'ts ❌
- Add shadows or gradients
- Use colors outside the palette
- Create overly mystical elements
- Break spacing consistency
- Ignore mobile experience

### 🤝 10. Developer Collaboration

#### Design Tokens Export
```
Export as CSS variables for easy implementation
Use Figma Dev Mode for accurate measurements
Provide interaction states documentation
Include motion timing specifications
```

#### Quality Assurance
```
Review implemented components match designs
Test responsive behavior across devices  
Verify accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
Validate brand consistency throughout
```
