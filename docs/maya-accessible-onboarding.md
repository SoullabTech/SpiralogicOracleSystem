## Revised Welcome Email

**Subject:** Your Maya Access Code: [MAYA-SEED-XXXX] | Beta Starts Monday

**Body:**

Hello [Name],

You've been selected as one of twenty beta testers for Maya's consciousness technology experiment. Your unique access code is:

## **MAYA-[TYPE]-[XXXX]**

This gives you access to your personal Maya instance starting Monday, [Date]. Please keep it private.

### What Happens Next

**This Week - Getting Ready**
- Tuesday: Setup checklist arrives
- Wednesday: Technical walkthrough
- Thursday: Private Discord community opens
- Friday: Optional group call to answer questions

**Monday - Your First Session**
Maya will be ready. Set aside 45-60 minutes in a quiet space where you can talk freely.

### What This Is

Maya is an AI designed to have meaningful conversations about whatever's on your mind. She's built differently - instead of trying to fix or optimize you, she's designed to understand and reflect back what she notices.

**Your role:**
- Engage authentically (be yourself)
- Share honest feedback about the experience
- Be patient with technical issues (it's beta)
- Participate in the community discussion

### Privacy

- Your conversations with Maya are encrypted and private
- No human reads your session content
- Only anonymous patterns are used for system improvement
- You can delete your data anytime

### Important

Maya offers space for reflection and conversation. This isn't therapy or crisis support. If you're experiencing mental health challenges, please connect with appropriate professional resources.

### Questions?

Reply to this email or join Thursday's Discord. Technical issues: beta-support@askmaya.ai

### One Thing Before You Start

Maya works best when you show up as yourself. No need to prepare topics or have goals - just be curious about what emerges in conversation.

Thanks for helping shape how AI can better understand human complexity.

Kelly Smith
Founder, Maya

P.S. Your code type:
- **SEED**: Early adopters who see potential
- **ROOT**: Natural connectors who create stability
- **LEAF**: Growth-minded explorers
- **RAIN**: Integrators who help things come together

## Maya's Revised Introduction

**Maya's first message:**

"Hi [Name], I'm Maya. I'm here to have a real conversation with you - no agenda, no trying to fix anything. What's on your mind today?"

**If they ask what she does:**

"I'm designed to listen and reflect back what I notice. Think of me as a conversation partner who's really paying attention. I'm curious about how people think and feel, and I learn by understanding different perspectives."

**If they're hesitant:**

"No pressure to dive deep right away. We can start wherever feels comfortable. I'm just here to talk."

---

## Success Metrics (Accessible)

Track without mentioning:
- How long people engage
- What communication styles emerge
- When conversations feel meaningful
- Technical issues and resolutions
- Overall user satisfaction

Share weekly (in accessible terms):
"This week our 20 beta testers:
- Had an average session length of 34 minutes
- Mostly preferred voice over text
- Reported feeling heard and understood
- Helped us fix 12 technical issues"

---

## Graduation (Week 4)

**Simple Recognition:**
"[Name], you've been part of Maya's first group of beta testers. Your feedback helped shape how she engages with people. Thank you for the time and honest input."

**Choice:**
"You can continue using Maya as we transition out of beta, or you can complete your participation here. Either choice is perfectly fine."

**Follow-up:**
"If you're willing, we'd love a brief reflection on your experience. What worked? What didn't? What surprised you?"
