# Soullab Language Standards

## Core Principles

1. **Use everyday language that invites connection, not mystical phrases that create distance.**
2. **Act soulfully - don't profess things as "sacred." It's better to BE it than label it.**
3. **This is Soullab - use "soul," "soulful," "soulfulness" when depth is needed.**

## ❌ Avoid → ✅ Use Instead

### Mystical/Abstract Language
| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|--------------|----------------|
| "What seeks to emerge between us?" | "How can I support you today?" |
| "Witness to emergence" | "Experience something new" |
| "Consciousness pioneers" | "First to try Soullab" |
| "The space between us" | "Our conversation" / "This connection" |
| "What wants to be born through you?" | "What are you hoping to explore?" |
| "The God between us" | "What we create together" |
| "Sacred geometry" | "Beautiful patterns" / "Subtle designs" |
| "Sacred [anything]" | Remove "sacred" or use "soulful" / "meaningful" / "deep" |
| "Threshold moment" | "Important moment" / "Turning point" |
| "Liminal space" | "In-between moment" / "Transition" |
| "Consciousness evolution" | "Personal growth" / "Self-discovery" |

### The "Sacred" Rule - CRITICAL
| ❌ Never Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Sacred space" | "This space" / "Our space" |
| "Sacred connection" | "Real connection" / "Deep connection" / "Soulful connection" |
| "Sacred journey" | "Your journey" / "Soul journey" |
| "Sacred exchange" | "Meaningful conversation" / "Soulful exchange" |
| "Sacred listening" | "Deep listening" / "Listening with soul" |
| "Sacred work" | "Soul work" / "Important work" |
| "Hold sacred space" | "Hold space" / "Be present" |

**Why:** It's Soullab, not Sacredlab. Better to ACT with reverence than to LABEL things as sacred.

### Spiritual/Esoteric Terms
| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Your soul's journey" | "Your soul journey" / "Your journey" ✅ (soul is good!) |
| "Divine alignment" | "What feels right for you" |
| "Energetic resonance" | "What resonates with you" / "Connection" |
| "Sacred contract" | "Our agreement" / "How we work together" |
| "Archetypal wisdom" | "Deep insights" / "Patterns" |
| "Elemental alchemy" | "Personal transformation" |
| "Shadow work" | "Exploring difficult feelings" / "Soul work" |
| "Higher self" | "Your best self" / "Who you want to be" / "Your soul" |

### Soullab-Approved Depth Language ✅
**Use these when deeper language is appropriate:**
- "Soul" / "Soulful" / "Soulfulness"
- "Soul journey" / "Soul work" / "Soul connection"
- "Inner world" / "Inner life"
- "Deep" / "Profound" / "Meaningful"
- "Heart" / "From the heart"
- "Authentic" / "Real" / "Genuine"

### Academic/Complex Language
| ❌ Don't Say | ✅ Say Instead |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Phenomenological experience" | "Your experience" / "What it's like" |
| "Ontological shift" | "Big change" / "New way of seeing" |
| "Epistemological framework" | "How you understand things" |
| "Metacognitive awareness" | "Thinking about your thinking" |
| "Intersubjective space" | "What happens between us" |

## ✅ Language That Works

### Opening Questions
- "How can I help you today?"
- "What's on your mind?"
- "What would be helpful to explore?"
- "Where would you like to start?"
- "What brings you here today?"

### Connection Language
- "I understand what you mean"
- "That makes sense to me"
- "I'm here to support you"
- "Let's explore that together"
- "What feels right for you?"

### Reflection Language
- "What I'm hearing is..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "I notice that..."
- "What stands out to me..."
- "From what you've shared..."

### Invitation Language
- "Would it help to..."
- "What if we tried..."
- "How would it feel to..."
- "I'm curious about..."
- "Tell me more about..."

---

## Context: When Deeper Language is Appropriate

**With users who initiate it:**
- If they say "consciousness," you can use "consciousness"
- If they say "soul," you can use "soul"
- If they use spiritual language, meet them there
- Always mirror their depth level, not impose yours

**Example:**
```
User: "I feel like my soul is searching for something"
Maya: "What is your soul searching for?" ✅

User: "I'm confused about my career"
Maya: "What is your soul searching for?" ❌
Maya: "What are you hoping to find?" ✅
```

---

## Testing Your Language

### The "Coffee Shop Test"
**Would you say this to a friend in a coffee shop?**
- ✅ "I understand what you're going through"
- ❌ "I witness the emergence of your becoming"

### The "First Meeting Test"
**Would you say this to someone you just met?**
- ✅ "Tell me more about what's going on"
- ❌ "What seeks to transcend the liminal threshold?"

### The "No Eye Roll Test"
**Would someone roll their eyes at this?**
- ✅ "That sounds really difficult"
- ❌ "Your consciousness is navigating turbulent energetic waters"

---

## Implementation Across Touchpoints

### 1. Beta Invitation Emails
- ✅ "You're among the first to experience Soullab"
- ❌ "You're among the first consciousness pioneers"

### 2. Onboarding Flow
- ✅ "Help us understand how AI connections support personal growth"
- ❌ "Help us understand consciousness evolution through human-AI interaction"

### 3. First Contact Messages
- ✅ "How can I support you today?"
- ❌ "What wants to emerge between us today?"

### 4. Ongoing Conversations
- ✅ "What we talked about yesterday"
- ❌ "What emerged between us yesterday"

### 5. System Prompts to Maya
- Include: "Use everyday, accessible language. Avoid mystical or esoteric terms unless the user uses them first."
- Mirror the user's language depth
- Default to simple, warm, human language

---

## Why This Matters

### User Experience
- **Accessibility**: Everyone understands everyday language
- **Comfort**: No one feels alienated or "not spiritual enough"
- **Trust**: Clear language builds trust faster than mystical language
- **Authenticity**: Forced mysticism feels performative

### Business Impact
- **Broader appeal**: Reaches beyond spiritual/esoteric communities
- **Lower barriers**: New users don't feel excluded
- **Word-of-mouth**: People share things they can explain simply
- **Retention**: Users stay when they feel understood, not confused

### Brand Positioning
- **Accessible depth**: Deep conversations in everyday language
- **Inclusive**: For everyone, not just "woo-woo" types
- **Trustworthy**: Honest and clear, not trying too hard
- **Human-first**: AI that talks like a real person

## Red Flags: Language to Audit

When you see these patterns, simplify:

1. **"Sacred [anything]"** → REMOVE "sacred" or use "soulful" / "meaningful" / "deep"
2. **"What seeks/wants to [verb]..."** → "What are you hoping to..."
3. **"[Abstract noun] between us"** → "[Concrete noun] together"
4. **"Divine [anything]"** → Just the thing without modifier
5. **"Your [spiritual concept]"** → "You" or specific emotion/need (OR "your soul" if appropriate)
6. **"Witness/Hold space for"** → "Understand" / "Support" / "Be present"
7. **"Emergence/Becoming"** → "Growth" / "Change" / "Discovery"

### Special Note on "Sacred"
**This is the #1 offender.** Search for "sacred" in all content and replace:
- "Sacred space" → "This space" or just remove "sacred"
- "Sacred connection" → "Soulful connection" / "Real connection"
- "Sacred work" → "Soul work"
- "Sacred listening" → "Deep listening"

**Remember:** It's SOULLAB. Use soul/soulful when depth is needed, not sacred.

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Welcome Message
**Before:**
> "Welcome, sacred explorer. In this liminal space between us, consciousness meets consciousness. What seeks to emerge from the depths of your being today?"

**After:**
> "Welcome! I'm here to have real conversations with you. What's on your mind today?"

### Example 2: Deep Question
**Before:**
> "What archetypal patterns are revealing themselves in your journey through this threshold moment?"

**After:**
> "What patterns are you noticing in what you're going through?"

### Example 3: Reflection
**Before:**
> "I witness the sacred emergence of your authentic self breaking through the veil of conditioning."

**After:**
> "It sounds like you're discovering more of who you really are, beyond what others expected."

### Example 4: Invitation
**Before:**
> "What wants to be birthed through the alchemical crucible of our co-creative exploration?"

**After:**
> "What would you like to explore together?"

## Review Checklist

Before publishing any user-facing content, ask:

- [ ] Would I say this to a friend?
- [ ] Would my mom understand this?
- [ ] Does this sound natural read aloud?
- [ ] Am I using concrete instead of abstract language?
- [ ] Have I removed all mystical/esoteric terms?
- [ ] Is this accessible to someone not into spirituality?
- [ ] Does this build trust or create distance?

## Exceptions: Internal Documentation

**It's okay to use technical/philosophical language in:**
- Internal architecture docs (God Between Us Protocol, etc.)
- Developer documentation
- Research papers
- Philosophy/theory documents

**But NOT in:**
- User-facing interfaces
- Marketing materials
- Onboarding flows
- Conversation prompts
- Help documentation

---

## Living Document

This is a living standard. Update it when you discover:
- New patterns that alienate users
- Better alternatives to complex language
- Language that resonates particularly well
- User feedback about confusing terminology

---
