## End-of-Beta Reflection

**After your final session:**

Write a letter to yourself to read in 6 months. Include:

1. **What shifted:** The specific changes you notice
2. **What you learned:** About your patterns and protections
3. **What you're practicing:** The new way of being you're cultivating
4. **What you appreciate:** About yourself for taking this journey
5. **What you want to remember:** The most important insight

Save this letter. Date it. Read it when you need to remember how far you've come.

## Optional: Cohort Sharing Prompts

**If you choose to share in Discord #reflections:**

Week 1: "I'm noticing I tend to..."
Week 2: "A pattern that surprised me was..."
Week 3: "Something shifted when..."
Week 4: "I'm leaving with..."

Remember: Share patterns and insights, never transcript content. Your privacy and others' is sacred.
