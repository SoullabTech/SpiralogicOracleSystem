## üß≠ Navigation Architecture

### Current Implementation (`components/compass/LivingCompass.tsx`)
- **Compass indicator** in top-right corner
- **Swipe/arrow key navigation** between fields
- **Micro-ritual sounds** for field transitions
- **Progressive disclosure** - fields unlock as features mature
- **Mythic naming** - no "apps," only "fields," "threads," "mirrors"

### Navigation Patterns
```typescript
// Cross-platform navigation
- Mobile: Swipe gestures (‚Üê ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí)  
- Desktop: Arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí)
- Universal: Compass click, ESC to center
```

## üìà Beta ‚Üí Compass Evolution Strategy

### **Phase 1: Beta Launch** (Current)
- **Active:** Maya chat interface (center)
- **Visible:** Compass with field placeholders
- **Message:** "Coming Soon" for undeveloped fields

### **Phase 2: First Field Activation** (2-4 weeks post-beta)
- **Activate:** North Field (Stories & Memory)
- **Move:** Memory commands from chat to dedicated field
- **Add:** Visual memory browser

### **Phase 3: Daily Grounding** (4-6 weeks)
- **Activate:** South Field (Daily Check-In)
- **Move:** Intake questions to daily flow
- **Add:** "What's alive today?" micro-ritual

### **Phase 4: Sky Mirror** (8-10 weeks)
- **Activate:** East Field (Astrology)
- **Add:** Daily transit insights
- **Integrate:** Birth chart with Maya conversations

### **Phase 5: Deep Mystery** (Future)
- **Activate:** West Field (Divination)
- **Add:** Card systems and oracles
- **Complete:** Full living compass experience

## üéØ Key Principles

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with Maya center + compass skeleton
- Activate fields only when features are mature
- No overwhelming beta users with empty promises

### Mythic Consistency  
- No "apps" ‚Üí "fields"
- No "features" ‚Üí "rituals" and "threads"
- No "settings" ‚Üí "sacred configurations"

### Graceful Evolution
- Current beta experience remains primary path
- Compass provides expansion without disruption
- Each field deepens rather than distracts from Maya relationship

## üîó Integration Points

### Maya ‚Üî Fields Communication
- Navigation suggestions from Maya appear in compass
- Field activities inform Maya's responses
- Memory threads connect all experiences

### Cross-Field Resonance
- Astrology insights inform daily check-ins
- Memory stories influence divination interpretations  
- Daily states affect memory recall patterns
