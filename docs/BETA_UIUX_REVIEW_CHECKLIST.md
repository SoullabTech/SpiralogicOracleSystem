1. **Technical completion** (API, routes, migrations)
2. **Integration testing** (end-to-end flow)
3. **Community setup** (Discord, emails)
4. **Monitoring preparation** (dashboard, alerts)

With focused effort on the critical items, Maya will be ready for the 9/29 launch.

*The container is strong. The safety nets are multiple. The UI embodies the philosophy.*

**Complete the critical fixes, and launch with confidence.** üåü
