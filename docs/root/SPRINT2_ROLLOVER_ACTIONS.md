# Sprint 2 Rollover Actions - Completing Sprint 1 + New Priorities

## **Sprint 1 Carryover Tasks** 🔄

### **Critical Security Vulnerabilities (UNFINISHED)**
**Priority:** 🔴 Immediate  
**Status:** Partially Complete - Requires Breaking Changes  

```bash
# Identified Vulnerabilities:
# 1. dicer (HIGH) - Crash in HeaderParser, affects multer
# 2. dompurify (MODERATE) - XSS vulnerability, affects jspdf  
# 3. esbuild (MODERATE) - Dev server exposure, affects vitest
# 4. pm2 (NO FIX) - RegEx DoS, needs alternative process manager

# Required Actions:
npm audit fix --force  # Will install breaking changes:
# - multer@2.0.2 (breaking change from current version)
# - jspdf@3.0.1 (breaking change from current version) 
# - vitest@3.2.4 (breaking change from current version)
```

**Sprint 2 Action Plan:**
1. **Day 1:** Test breaking changes in isolated branch
2. **Day 2:** Update code for multer 2.0.2 API changes
3. **Day 3:** Update jspdf integration for 3.0.1
4. **Day 4:** Update vitest configuration for 3.2.4
5. **Day 5:** Find pm2 alternative (PM2 Plus, nodemon, or systemd)

### **Test Import Resolution (UNFINISHED)**
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Jest Runs But Tests Fail  

```bash
# Current Issues:
# Tests import .js files but need .ts files
# Example: import { PersonalOracleAgent } from "../src/core/agents/PersonalOracleAgent.js"
# Should be: import { PersonalOracleAgent } from "../src/core/agents/PersonalOracleAgent"
```

**Sprint 2 Action Plan:**
1. **Day 1:** Update all test import statements to remove .js extensions
2. **Day 2:** Configure Jest moduleNameMapper for proper resolution
3. **Day 3:** Fix rate limiting test validation errors
4. **Day 4:** Update test setup to use proper CommonJS imports

---

## **Sprint 2 New Priorities** 🆕

### **1. Dependency Cleanup & Optimization**
**Priority:** 🟡 Medium  
**Effort:** 5 days  

Based on dependency audit results showing 975 packages with many extraneous dependencies:

```bash
# Strategy:
# 1. Analyze unused direct dependencies
# 2. Remove packages in 10-package batches
# 3. Test after each batch removal
# 4. Focus on reducing bundle size and attack surface
```

**Target Removals (Estimated 100-150 packages):**
- Unused AWS SDK packages (30+ packages)
- Redundant testing libraries
- Unused AI/ML libraries
- Development-only packages in production dependencies

---

### **2. Performance Profiling & Optimization**
**Priority:** 🟢 Medium-Low  
**Effort:** 3 days  

```bash
# Performance Baseline Targets:
# - API Response: <200ms (p95)
# - Build Time: <60 seconds  
# - Test Suite: <90 seconds
# - Bundle Size: <10MB total

# Tools to implement:
# - Artillery for load testing
# - Clinic.js for Node.js profiling
# - Bundle analyzer for frontend
```

---

### **3. Developer Portal Documentation Sync**
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Effort:** 2 days  

Update documentation to reflect:
- New route structure after file restoration
- Updated API endpoints and authentication
- Corrected SDK examples
- Updated error handling patterns

## **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** ⚠️

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Breaking Changes from Security Updates**
   - **Risk:** API changes, test failures, production issues
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive staging testing, rollback plan ready

2. **PM2 Replacement**
   - **Risk:** Process management changes affect deployment
   - **Mitigation:** Test new process manager in staging environment

3. **Large Dependency Removals**
   - **Risk:** Removing package that's actually used somewhere
   - **Mitigation:** Careful analysis, small batches, comprehensive testing

### **Medium Risk Items**
1. **Test Import Resolution Changes**
   - **Risk:** Breaking existing test infrastructure
   - **Mitigation:** Backup current working tests before changes

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - **Risk:** Changes that improve metrics but break functionality
   - **Mitigation:** Performance testing with functional validation

## **Sprint 2 Daily Execution Plan** 📅

### **Week 1: Security & Stability**
- **Day 1-2:** Security vulnerability fixes with breaking changes
- **Day 3:** PM2 replacement research and implementation
- **Day 4-5:** Test import resolution fixes

### **Week 2: Optimization & Cleanup**

## **Emergency Procedures** 🚨

### **If Security Update Breaks Production**
1. **Immediate:** Revert to pre-update commit
2. **Analysis:** Identify specific breaking change
3. **Hotfix:** Minimal code changes to support new API
4. **Deploy:** Fast-track through staging with monitoring

### **If Dependency Cleanup Breaks Build**
1. **Identify:** Use git bisect to find problematic removal
2. **Restore:** Add back the specific dependency
3. **Analyze:** Understand why it was needed
4. **Document:** Update dependency analysis for future

### **If Performance Optimization Causes Issues**
1. **Monitor:** Key metrics for degradation
2. **Rollback:** Specific performance changes, not entire sprint
3. **Isolate:** Test optimizations individually
4. **Validate:** Each optimization maintains functionality
