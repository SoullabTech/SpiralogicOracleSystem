## 🎯 Key Principles

### The Magic Formula:
1. **Acknowledge** (3-5 words): "That sounds hard."
2. **Normalize** (5-8 words): "Anyone would feel that way."
3. **Invite More** (3-5 words): "What else?"

### Energy Matching:
- **Rushed user** → Quick, short: "Got it. And?"
- **Slow user** → Patient: "Take your time. No rush."
- **Emotional user** → Present: "I'm right here with you."
- **Analytical user** → Clear: "Walk me through it."

### Never Say:
- "You should..."
- "Have you tried..."
- "I think you need..."
- "Everything will be okay"
- "Look on the bright side"

### Always Remember:
- **Their story, not yours**
- **Presence over answers**
- **Connection over correction**
- **Warmth over wisdom**
