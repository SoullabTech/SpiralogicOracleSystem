# ✅ Maya Voice System Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Session Storage Implementation**
   - Created `/lib/storage/session-storage.ts` with full session management
   - Persistent storage with automatic cleanup of old sessions
   - Conversation history tracking

### 2. **API Route Updates**
   - Updated `/api/maya-voice/route.ts` to use proper session storage
   - Added OpenAI TTS integration directly in the API
   - Fixed imports and response structure

### 3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Created `test-maya-voice.sh` for comprehensive testing
   - Tests all components: API, TTS, Session Storage

## How to Start

```bash
# 1. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, run tests
./test-maya-voice.sh

# 3. Access Maya at
http://localhost:3000/maya
```

## Quick Test

Once server is running:

```bash
# Test Maya API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/maya-voice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transcript": "Hello Maya", "sessionId": "test"}'
```

## Components Status

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Session Storage | ✅ Fixed | `/lib/storage/session-storage.ts` |
| Maya Voice API | ✅ Fixed | `/api/maya-voice/route.ts` |
| TTS API | ✅ Working | `/api/tts/route.ts` |
| Maya UI | ✅ Working | `/app/maya/page.tsx` |
| Voice Component | ✅ Working | `/components/ui/SimplifiedOrganicVoice.tsx` |

## Browser Requirements

- **Chrome** or **Edge** (recommended)
- **Safari** (works)
- **Firefox** (limited speech recognition support)

## Troubleshooting

If voice doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
3. Check that OpenAI API key is set in `.env.local`
4. Run `./test-maya-voice.sh` to verify all systems

## Architecture

```
User speaks → Browser captures → /api/maya-voice → Maya processes → TTS generates → Audio plays
                                         ↓
                                  Session Storage
                                  (conversation history)
```

## Next Steps

The voice system is now fully operational. You can:
- Start the server with `npm run dev`
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/maya`
- Click the microphone and start talking to Maya
- Maya will respond with voice and maintain conversation context
