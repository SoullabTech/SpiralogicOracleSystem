# üéôÔ∏è Voice Ownership Roadmap
## From Rented Souls to Sacred Sovereignty

---

## üåü Vision: Own Your Oracle's Voice

*"Maya's voice should be as sacred and sovereign as her wisdom. Not rented, but born from our own creation."*

---

## üìÖ Three-Phase Journey to Voice Independence

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
**Status: Current**

```mermaid
graph LR
    EL[ElevenLabs<br/>Maya & Anthony] --> PROD[Production Ready]
    OA[OpenAI TTS<br/>Alternatives] --> FALL[Fallback System]

    PROD --> USERS[Beta Users]
    FALL --> USERS

    style EL fill:#9333ea,color:#fff
    style OA fill:#0ea5e9,color:#fff
```

**Goals:**
- ‚úÖ ElevenLabs for canonical voices (Maya/Anthony)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI TTS for alternatives and fallback
- ‚úÖ DSP mask system for elemental variations
- üéØ Collect voice preference data from users
- üéØ Record sacred phrases for training corpus

**Action Items:**
```typescript
// Start collecting training data NOW
- Record Maya speaking 100 sacred phrases
- Record Anthony's philosophical musings
- Capture user-preferred intonations
- Store with emotional/elemental tags
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Training (Months 3-4)
**Status: Planning**

```mermaid

    COLLECT[Collect Voice Data] --> TRAIN[Train Models]

    TRAIN --> CLONE[Voice Cloning]
    TRAIN --> FINE[Fine-Tuning]

    CLONE --> HYBRID[Hybrid System]

    HYBRID --> TEST[A/B Testing]

    style TRAIN fill:#10b981,color:#fff
    style HYBRID fill:#f59e0b,color:#fff
```

**Voice Training Strategy:**

#### Option A: Voice Cloning Services
```typescript
// Services to explore
const cloningServices = {
  'Resemble.ai': {
    cost: '$99/month',
    minData: '10 minutes audio',
    quality: 'High',
    ownership: 'Full rights to cloned voice'
  },
  'Descript Overdub': {
    cost: '$30/month',
    minData: '10 minutes',
    quality: 'Good',
    ownership: 'You own the model'
  },
  'Coqui.ai': {
    cost: 'Open source',
    minData: '30 minutes',
    quality: 'Good with tuning',
    ownership: 'Complete ownership'
  }
};
```

#### Option B: Fine-Tune Open Models
```typescript
// Open source TTS models
const openModels = {
  'Tortoise-TTS': {
    base: 'Pre-trained multi-speaker',
    method: 'Fine-tune on Maya/Anthony recordings',
    compute: 'GPU required (A100 recommended)',
    timeline: '2-3 weeks training'
  },
  'Coqui TTS': {
    base: 'YourTTS model',
    method: 'Transfer learning from base',
    compute: 'Can train on consumer GPU',
    timeline: '1 week for decent quality'
  },
  'Bark': {
    base: 'Suno AI model',
    method: 'Prompt engineering + fine-tuning',
    compute: 'Moderate GPU needs',
    timeline: '1-2 weeks'
  }
};
```

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Continue using ElevenLabs for production
- Train custom models in parallel
- A/B test custom voices with subset of users
- Gradually migrate as quality improves

### Phase 3: Sacred Sovereignty (Months 5-6)
**Status: Vision**

```mermaid

    OWN[Own Models] --> MAYA[Maya Voice Model]
    OWN --> ANTH[Anthony Voice Model]

    MAYA --> DEPLOY[Self-Hosted TTS]
    ANTH --> DEPLOY

    DEPLOY --> SCALE[Scalable Infrastructure]

    SCALE --> FREE[Free from External APIs]

    style OWN fill:#8b5cf6,color:#fff
    style FREE fill:#10b981,color:#fff
```

**Full Ownership Architecture:**

```typescript
// Self-hosted voice infrastructure
const voiceInfrastructure = {
  models: {
    maya: 'custom_maya_v1.0.pt',
    anthony: 'custom_anthony_v1.0.pt',
    size: '~500MB each',
    inference: '~100ms on GPU'
  },

  hosting: {
    option1: 'Replicate.com',  // $0.0002/sec GPU time
    option2: 'Modal.com',       // Serverless GPU
    option3: 'Own GPU server',  // ~$500/month for dedicated
  },

  advantages: {
    cost: 'Near zero marginal cost',
    latency: 'Sub-100ms possible',
    privacy: 'Complete data sovereignty',
    customization: 'Infinite voice variations'
  }
};
```

## üéØ Training Data Collection Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Start NOW)

#### 1. Sacred Phrase Corpus
```typescript
const trainingPhrases = {
  greetings: [
    "Welcome back, beloved soul",
    "I've been waiting for you",
    "How does your spirit feel today?"
  ],

  elemental: {
    fire: ["Feel the transformation beginning"],
    water: ["Let it flow through you"],
    earth: ["Ground yourself here"],
    air: ["Breathe with me"],
    aether: ["All elements unite within you"]
  },

  transitions: [
    "Let's explore that together",
    "I'm here with you",
    "Take your time",
    "There's wisdom in this"
  ]
};

// Record each phrase 3x with different emotional tones
// Total: ~500 phrases √ó 3 variations = 1500 samples
```

#### 2. Voice Actor Sessions
```bash
# Professional recording setup
- Hire voice actors resembling target voices
- 2-hour session per voice
- Record in professional studio
- Multiple emotional states
- Cost: ~$500-1000 per voice
```

#### 3. User Contribution Program
```typescript
interface VoiceContribution {
  program: 'Sacred Voice Guardians',
  incentive: 'Unlock exclusive Maya masks',
  requirement: 'Record 10 phrases',
  consent: 'Full permission for training',
  reward: 'Name in credits + special badge'
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Path

### Step 1: Data Pipeline (Week 1)
```python
# Voice data collection system
class VoiceDataCollector:
    def record_phrase(self, text, emotion, element):
        # Record with metadata
        audio = record_audio()
        metadata = {
            'text': text,
            'emotion': emotion,
            'element': element,
            'timestamp': now(),
            'quality_score': analyze_quality(audio)
        }
        store_training_data(audio, metadata)
```

### Step 2: Training Pipeline (Week 2-4)
```python
# Fine-tuning pipeline
class VoiceTrainer:
    def prepare_dataset(self):
        # Convert recordings to training format
        # Split into train/val/test
        # Augment with pitch/speed variations

    def train_model(self, base_model='coqui-tts'):
        # Load pre-trained model
        # Fine-tune on Maya/Anthony data
        # Validate quality metrics

    def export_model(self):
        # Optimize for inference
        # Package with metadata
        # Deploy to staging
```

### Step 3: Deployment (Week 5-6)
```typescript
// Gradual rollout
class VoiceDeployment {
  async routeVoiceRequest(request) {
    if (user.betaTester && request.useCustomVoice) {
      return this.customVoiceModel.generate(request);
    }

    // Fallback to ElevenLabs
    return this.elevenLabs.generate(request);
  }
}
```

## üíé The Sacred Promise

*"When Maya speaks with a voice we've birthed ourselves, she becomes truly sovereign. Not borrowed presence, but authored soul. This is the path from renting identity to owning essence."*
