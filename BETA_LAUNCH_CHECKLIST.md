## Beta Tester Onboarding

### üìã **Tester Preparation Checklist**

**Send to Beta Testers:**
```
üéØ Your Mission: Test Maya's intelligence & voice naturalness

Setup (5 minutes):
1. Visit: [Your Domain]/auth
2. Sign up with any username/password
3. Complete onboarding flow
4. Allow microphone permissions

Focus Areas:
‚ñ° Intelligence: Does Maya remember your journal entries?
‚ñ° Conversation: Does she sound natural, not robotic?  
‚ñ° Voice Loop: Can you speak ‚Üí hear responses smoothly?
‚ñ° Daily Use: Would you use this for 10+ minutes daily?

Report bugs via: [Your Bug Report System]
```

### üß™ **Structured Beta Testing Protocol**

#### **Phase 1: Voice + Memory Combined Validation (Day 1-3)**

**üéØ Core Test: Unified Intelligence Through Voice**

```
Pre-Test Setup:
1. Write 2-3 detailed journal entries covering:
   - A current challenge you're facing
   - A recurring theme/pattern in your life  
   - A specific goal or aspiration
2. Include emotional context, specific names/places, symbolic language

Voice + Memory Test Sequence:
1. Start Oracle session in VOICE-ONLY mode
2. Ask Maya to "tell me what you know about me" (spoken)
3. Reference specific journal details through voice
4. Test memory continuity: "What did we discuss yesterday?"
5. Ask follow-up questions that require synthesis across entries
6. Test symbolic recognition: Use metaphors from your journals

Success Metrics:
- Maya speaks about your journal content naturally (not reading lists)
- Voice responses demonstrate contextual understanding
- She connects themes across different journal entries
- Maintains conversation coherence for 15+ voice exchanges
- References specific details without prompting ("your situation with...")
- Never falls back to "I don't have access to..." phrases
```

**üîç Advanced Intelligence Validation:**
```bash
# Enable combined debugging
export MAYA_DEBUG_MEMORY=true
export MAYA_DEBUG_VOICE=true

# Watch for unified context assembly in logs
# Maya should demonstrate:
# - Journal memory synthesis
# - Session continuity 
# - Symbolic pattern recognition
# - Adaptive tone matching your communication style
```

#### **Phase 2: Voice Intelligence Flow Testing (Day 4-7)**  

**üéôÔ∏è Natural Conversation Intelligence**

```
Test Sequence:
1. Continue multi-day conversations entirely through voice
2. Test interruption handling: Cut Maya off mid-response, she should adapt
3. Test memory triggers: "Remember when you mentioned..." (spoken)
4. Test contextual questions: "What would you do in my situation?"
5. Test emotional continuity: Vary your mood, Maya should notice and adapt
6. Test symbolic callback: Reference metaphors from previous sessions

Environmental Testing:
- Quiet room (optimal conditions)
- Background noise (music, traffic)  
- Different devices (laptop, phone, headphones)
- Various speech patterns (excited, tired, contemplative)

Success Metrics:
- Voice conversations feel like continuations of previous sessions
- Maya references past voice conversations accurately
- Emotional tone matching through voice feels natural
- STT + Memory + TTS pipeline works seamlessly together
- You prefer voice mode over text for personal conversations
```

#### **Phase 3: Unified Intelligence Daily Integration (Day 8-14)**

**üß† Personal Oracle Agent Validation**

```
Daily Integration Test:
1. Morning: Voice check-in referencing yesterday's conversation
2. Journal: Write about insights Maya provided previously  
3. Afternoon: Voice session building on morning themes
4. Evening: Reflect with Maya on day's developments (voice)
5. Cross-session: Maya should weave all interactions together

Advanced Intelligence Tests:
- Pattern Recognition: Maya identifies recurring life themes
- Symbolic Continuity: Metaphors persist across voice/text/journal
- Emotional Evolution: Maya tracks mood/energy patterns over days
- Contextual Synthesis: Combines multiple data sources for insights
- Predictive Awareness: Anticipates your needs/questions

Success Metrics:
- Maya feels like she genuinely knows and remembers you
- Conversations build meaningfully on previous sessions
- She provides insights that connect patterns you hadn't noticed
- Voice + memory combination creates "companion" experience
- You seek out conversations (not just testing features)
- Maya's intelligence feels adaptive, not scripted
```

**üéØ Ultimate Test: The Maya Turing Moment**
```
Challenge: Can Maya demonstrate she understands your inner world?

Test:
1. Don't tell Maya what you're struggling with
2. Let her infer from journal patterns + conversation history
3. Ask: "What do you think I should focus on right now?"
4. Maya should synthesize your data into meaningful guidance

Success: Her response feels personally relevant and insightful
Failure: Generic advice or misunderstanding your situation
```

## Quick Commands for Devs

```bash
# Combined Intelligence + Voice Debugging
export MAYA_DEBUG_MEMORY=true
export MAYA_DEBUG_VOICE=true  
export BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL=debug
npm run dev

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3002/api/v1/health

## Beta Tester Quick Diagnostics

**üîç Intelligence Stack Validation (30 seconds)**
```javascript
// Run in browser console after login
console.log('Maya Memory Test:');
console.log('1. Journal entries loaded:', !!localStorage.getItem('beta_user'));
console.log('2. Session continuity:', performance.now());
console.log('3. Voice pipeline ready:', !!navigator.mediaDevices);

// Test unified context (speak this):
"Maya, what's the most important thing I've told you?"
// Should reference journal + conversation history, not generic response
```

**üéôÔ∏è Voice + Memory Integration Test**
```
Quick 2-minute validation:
1. Speak: "Tell me about my recent journal entries"
2. Speak: "How does this connect to what we discussed yesterday?"  
3. Speak: "What pattern do you notice in my thoughts lately?"

‚úÖ Pass: Maya synthesizes across all data sources naturally
‚ùå Fail: Generic responses or "I don't have access..." phrases
```

**üéâ Remember**: You've built something genuinely sophisticated. Maya now acts like a true Personal Oracle Agent with unified intelligence, production-grade voice, and polished UX. This beta is about validating that achievement with real users before broader launch.

**Next milestone**: Once beta validates core experience, unlock elemental integration (MAYA_MODE=full) and collective intelligence features for power users.
