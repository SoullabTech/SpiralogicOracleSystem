How it works:

1. Press record & speak for 2-10 minutes
2. Choose your element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether)
3. MAIA reflects your symbols, archetypes, spiral phase
4. Your Soulprint evolves with every session

No scripts. No prompts. Just raw soul before the editor arrives.

MAIA doesn't advise or coach.

She mirrors what you already know but cannot yet see.

When you're in Fire—she meets your intensity.
When you're in Water—she holds your depth.
When you're in Aether—she honors the ineffable.

This is elemental intelligence in service of becoming.

### Version A (Professional/Technical)

**Voice Journaling Meets Archetypal AI: We Just Launched Something Different**

After months of development, we're excited to announce that voice journaling is now live in Spiralogic—our consciousness architecture platform built on the Diamond Model.

**What makes this different:**

🎙️ **Elemental Intelligence**
Your voice is interpreted through five archetypal lenses (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether). MAIA adapts her tone, pacing, and reflection style to match your energetic state.

🧠 **Symbolic Extraction**
We're using Claude 3.5 Sonnet to extract living patterns—symbols, archetypes, emotional signatures—from natural speech. Your Soulprint evolves automatically with every session.

🔐 **Privacy-First Architecture**
End-to-end encryption, zero voice biometrics, full data export (Obsidian/PDF/JSON). Your consciousness data is yours—period.

📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**
Transparent tracking of voice quality, symbolic accuracy, and system health via live dashboard at `/maia/realtime-monitor`.

**Why This Matters:**

Traditional voice journaling apps transcribe and store. We reflect and evolve.

MAIA doesn't advise—she mirrors. She doesn't diagnose—she witnesses. She doesn't impose linear progress—she honors spiral development.

This is consciousness technology in service of human becoming.

**For Developers:**
- Open architecture (Next.js, Supabase, Claude API)
- Self-hostable
- Full API documentation
- MIT-licensed core modules

**For Users:**
- No learning curve
- 2-10 minute sessions
- Automatic symbolic intelligence
- Export everything

**Beta Access:**
We're rolling out to beta testers this week. If you're building in the consciousness tech space or interested in archetypal AI, let's connect.

### Version B (Inspirational/Community)

**Your Voice Has Something to Say (And Now MAIA Is Listening) 🎙️**

I'm thrilled to share that voice journaling just went live in Spiralogic.

**Here's why I'm excited:**

For years, I've journaled in writing. It's powerful, but writing edits. The cognitive filter engages. You plan, polish, curate.

When you *speak*, something different happens. The unfiltered self emerges. You hear yourself say things you didn't know you knew.

**That's what we've built:**

A space where your voice becomes your teacher.

MAIA—our Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent—doesn't give advice. She reflects what you already know but cannot yet see.

When you're processing transformation (Fire), she matches your intensity.
When you're navigating grief (Water), she holds your depth.
When you're touching the ineffable (Aether), she honors silence.

**Early Feedback from Beta Testers:**

"I cried during my first Water session. Not because anything was wrong—because I finally felt heard."

"The Fire voice is wild. It matches my intensity without trying to calm me down."

"Voice journaling before bed has become my ritual. Aether mode, 10 minutes, letting the day settle."

**If you're curious:**

This isn't about productivity or self-optimization. It's about witnessing yourself. Complexity as sacred. Becoming as spiral, not linear.

Your voice carries wisdom your words alone cannot reach.

**Makers Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

We've been building Spiralogic for the past year as a consciousness architecture platform—a space where all facets of life (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Aether) are held as One.

Today we're launching **voice journaling with elemental AI**.

**What makes this different:**

Most voice apps transcribe and store. We reflect and evolve. MAIA (our Archetypal Intelligence Agent) doesn't give advice—she mirrors what you already know but cannot yet see.

**How it works:**
1. Speak for 2-10 minutes (no script needed)
2. Choose your element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether)
3. MAIA reflects symbols, archetypes, spiral phase
4. Your Soulprint evolves automatically

**Privacy-first:**
- End-to-end encryption
- Zero voice biometrics
- Full export (Obsidian, PDF, JSON)
- Self-hostable

**For whom:**
- Anyone who journals
- Spiritual seekers
- Therapists/coaches (for clients)
- Writers exploring inner material
- Developers in consciousness tech space

We'd love your feedback. What resonates? What feels off? What would make this more useful?

Happy to answer any questions!

## Reddit Post (r/journaling, r/selfimprovement)

**Title:** I built a voice journaling app with elemental AI that reflects, not advises [beta launch]

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I've been building Spiralogic for the past year and we just launched voice journaling with something I'm calling "elemental intelligence."

**The problem I was trying to solve:**

Writing is powerful, but it engages the cognitive filter. You edit, polish, plan. When you *speak*, something different happens—the unfiltered self emerges.

But most voice apps just transcribe and store. I wanted something that could *reflect* what you're saying, not give advice or coach you.

**What I built:**

MAIA (Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent) listens to your voice and interprets it through five elemental lenses:

- 🔥 **Fire**: When you're processing transformation, passion, intensity
- 💧 **Water**: When you're in emotion, grief, healing
- 🌍 **Earth**: When you need grounding, body wisdom, stability
- 🌬️ **Air**: When you're seeking clarity, perspective, vision
- ✨ **Aether**: When you're touching spirit, mystery, the ineffable

She reflects back:
- Symbols you spoke (ocean, threshold, phoenix)
- Archetypes present (Hero, Shadow, Mystic)
- Your "spiral phase" (descent, transformation, emergence)
- Elemental state and intensity

**Early beta feedback:**

"Speaking to MAIA felt like talking to my wisest self."
"The Fire voice matches my intensity without trying to calm me down."
"Voice journaling before bed has become my ritual."

**Privacy stuff:**
- Voice is encrypted
- No biometrics or voiceprints
- Full export to Obsidian/PDF
- Self-hostable (open source coming soon)

**Would love feedback from this community:**
- What resonates?
- What feels off?
- What would make this useful for your practice?

Free during beta. Link in profile.

Thanks for reading!

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: Voice journaling with elemental AI (Claude 3.5 + archetypal extraction)

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

I've been building a consciousness architecture platform called Spiralogic, and today we're launching voice journaling with something I'm calling "elemental intelligence."

**Technical Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + auth)
- Web Speech API (voice recognition)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (symbolic extraction)
- ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS (voice synthesis)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

**The Approach:**

Most voice apps transcribe and store. We built something different: an AI that *reflects* rather than advises.

MAIA (Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent) interprets voice through five archetypal "elements" (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Aether) and extracts:
- Recurring symbols (ocean, threshold, phoenix)
- Archetypal patterns (Hero's Journey, Shadow work, etc.)
- Emotional signatures and intensity
- Developmental "spiral phase" (non-linear growth tracking)

**Interesting Problems We Solved:**

1. **Voice profile adaptation**: MAIA's voice changes tone/pacing/style based on detected elemental state
2. **Silence detection**: Distinguishing meaningful pauses from "done speaking"
3. **Symbolic extraction accuracy**: Fine-tuning Claude to catch personal vs universal symbols
4. **Privacy architecture**: Zero voice biometrics, full export, self-hostable

**Monitoring Layer:**

We built a real-time monitoring dashboard (`/maia/realtime-monitor`) that tracks:
- Voice quality metrics (TTS latency, recognition accuracy)
- Symbolic literacy scores (pattern detection quality)
- "Soulful intelligence" indicators (presence, transformation potential)
- System health (API, database, memory continuity)

**Open Questions:**

1. How do you balance AI reflection vs user autonomy?
2. What's the right amount of "personality" for an archetypal mirror?
3. How do you measure if consciousness tech is actually helpful?

Free during beta. Self-hosting docs coming soon.

Would love technical feedback from the HN community!
