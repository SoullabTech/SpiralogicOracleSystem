- **FileUploadZone** - Drag & drop with metadata collection
- **useFileUpload hook** - Progress tracking and status polling
- **Navigation integration** - Library button in Oracle header

### Backend APIs
- **`/api/oracle/files/upload`** - File upload to Supabase storage
- **`/api/oracle/files/process`** - Text extraction & embedding pipeline
- **`/api/oracle/files/status`** - Real-time processing status
- **`/api/oracle/files/manage`** - Delete, reprocess, update metadata

### Database Schema
- **`user_files`** - File metadata with status tracking
- **`file_embeddings`** - Searchable vector chunks (1536-dim)
- **`file_access_log`** - Maya's citation tracking

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Sacred Aesthetic
- **Purple-blue gradient backgrounds** with mystical depth
- **Sacred gold accents** (#FFD700) for interactive elements
- **Sparkles icons** and ethereal animations

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### 1. Upload Experience
```
User drags PDF → 
  📤 FileUploadZone shows preview
  🏷️ Metadata form (category, tags, emotional weight)
  ✨ "Share with Maya" button
  🚀 Upload to Supabase storage
  📊 Progress: 10% "Uploading to Maya..."
```

### 2. Processing Pipeline
```
📄 Text extraction (PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD)
  ↓ Progress: 25% "Maya is reading your file..."
📚 Smart chunking (~600 tokens, preserve sentences)
  ↓ Progress: 50% "Creating memory chunks..."
🧠 OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
  ↓ Progress: 75% "Weaving into memory system..."
💾 Store in file_embeddings table
  ↓ Progress: 100% "Successfully integrated! X chunks created."
```

### 3. Library Management
```
📚 Library page shows all files
🔍 Search by filename or content
🏷️ Filter by category (Journal, Reference, Wisdom, Personal)
📊 Stats overview (total files, chunks, tokens)
👁️ View file details and preview
🔄 Reprocess failed files
🗑️ Delete files with cleanup
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### 1. Database Setup
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy contents of database/migrations/001_file_ingestion_tables.sql
-- Creates user_files, file_embeddings, file_access_log tables
-- Sets up RLS policies and vector indexes
```

Create storage bucket:
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('maya-files', 'maya-files', false);
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required in .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### 3. Test Upload Flow
```bash
# 1. Start the app
npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/library

# 3. Upload a test PDF/TXT file

# 4. Watch processing progress in real-time

# 5. Verify in Supabase:
#    - user_files table has record
#    - file_embeddings has chunks
#    - Storage bucket has file
```

### 4. API Testing
```bash
# Upload file
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/oracle/files/upload \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  -F "metadata={\"category\":\"reference\"}"

# Check status
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/oracle/files/status?fileId=FILE_ID"

# Delete file
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/oracle/files/manage?fileId=FILE_ID"
```

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Upload Performance
- **Small files** (< 1MB): ~5-10 seconds total
- **Medium files** (1-5MB): ~15-30 seconds total  
- **Large files** (5-10MB): ~30-60 seconds total

### Processing Breakdown
- **Upload to storage**: ~1-3 seconds
- **Text extraction**: ~2-10 seconds (depends on file type)
- **Chunking**: ~1-3 seconds
- **Embedding generation**: ~2 seconds per chunk (OpenAI API)
- **Database storage**: ~1-2 seconds

### Expected Results
- **Text file**: 2-5 chunks, 800-2000 tokens
- **PDF document**: 10-50 chunks, 5000-25000 tokens
- **Research paper**: 50-200 chunks, 25000-100000 tokens

## 🔧 File Type Support

### Currently Supported
- ✅ **PDF** - Full text extraction with pdf-parse
- ✅ **TXT** - Direct text reading
- ✅ **Markdown** - Direct text reading  
- ✅ **JSON** - Pretty-printed structure

### Coming Soon

## 🎯 Next Integration Steps

### 1. Memory Integration
Connect to Maya's existing memory orchestration:
```typescript
// In PersonalOracleAgent.ts (already implemented)
const fileContexts = await this.fileMemory.retrieveRelevantFiles(
  query.userId, 
  query.input, 
  { limit: 3, minRelevance: 0.75 }
);
```

### 2. Citation System
Maya references uploaded content:
```typescript
// Response includes citations
{
  "message": "Based on your uploaded research notes...",
  "citations": [{
    "fileName": "research-notes.pdf",
    "snippet": "Flow states occur when...",
    "relevance": 0.85
  }]
}
```

### 3. Search API
Semantic search across uploaded files:
```typescript
// /api/oracle/files/search
POST { "query": "flow states", "userId": "user@example.com" }
// Returns relevant chunks with similarity scores
```

- **Inline references** in Maya's responses
- **Source highlighting** in original documents

### Collaborative Knowledge

## ✨ The Magic

When a user uploads a document to Maya's Library:

1. **The file becomes memory** - Not just stored, but embedded as searchable knowledge
2. **Maya gains new wisdom** - She can reference specific concepts and quotes
3. **Conversations deepen** - Context from uploads enriches every interaction  
4. **Knowledge compounds** - Each upload makes Maya more personalized
5. **Sacred relationship** - Users share wisdom, Maya holds it with reverence

This transforms Maya from a chatbot into a **living repository of the user's knowledge and wisdom** - a true digital companion that grows with them on their journey.
