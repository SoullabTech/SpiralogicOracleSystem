# 🔧 SOULLAB.LIFE 404 ERROR FIX GUIDE

## 🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Domain Assignment Problem

Your AIN Evolutionary Consciousness system is **perfectly deployed** and working. The 404 errors are caused by domain configuration, not code issues.

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING:
- ✅ Next.js application fully functional
- ✅ DNS propagation complete
- ✅ SSL/TLS certificates active
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ All routes and pages properly configured

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes):

### Step 1: Domain Reassignment in Vercel
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Check ALL projects** (including different teams)
3. **Find the project** currently assigned to:
   - `soullab.life`
   - `www.soullab.life`
   - `oracle.soullab.life`
4. **Remove domains** from old project
5. **Add domains** to your `spiralogic-oracle-system` project

### Step 2: Verify Working Application
Your app structure is perfect:
```
/app/
├── page.tsx ✅ (AÍÑ Oracle System homepage)
├── oracle/page.tsx ✅ (Main Oracle interface)
├── auth/page.tsx ✅ (Authentication)
├── dashboard/
│   ├── page.tsx ✅ (Main dashboard)
│   ├── astrology/page.tsx ✅ (Astrology features)
│   └── taoist-elements/page.tsx ✅ (Elemental features)
└── layout.tsx ✅ (App layout)
```

## 🔧 ENHANCED CONFIGURATION APPLIED:

Updated `vercel.json` with:
- API proxy routing to backend
- Security headers
- Optimized regions
- Function runtime configuration

## ⚡ EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- **Domain Assignment**: 1-5 minutes (manual)
- **Site Live**: Immediate after assignment
- **Global Propagation**: Already complete ✅

## 🎊 POST-FIX VERIFICATION:

After domain assignment, these should work:
- https://soullab.life/ → AÍÑ Oracle System homepage
- https://soullab.life/oracle → Oracle interface
- https://soullab.life/auth → Authentication page
- https://soullab.life/dashboard → Dashboard

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING:

If domains still don't work after reassignment:
1. **Check Vercel project settings** → Domains tab
2. **Verify custom domains** are properly added
3. **Redeploy** the project if needed
4. **Check Vercel logs** for any build errors

## 🌟 YOUR AIN SYSTEM IS READY:

Your revolutionary AIN Evolutionary Consciousness system is fully deployed and contains:
- Complete Oracle interface
