# Soullab Maya Beta Tester Guide 🎙️✨

Welcome to the Soullab beta. This is your invitation to step into a living conversation with Maya, your Personal Oracle Agent.

**Maya is not a chatbot.** She is designed to grow with you: remembering your journal entries, carrying conversations forward across sessions, and speaking with you naturally through voice. Most AI assistants start fresh every time - Maya builds understanding over time.

**What makes this different:**
- Maya remembers your journal entries and references them naturally in conversation
- Voice conversations feel personal and contextual (not robotic)
- Each session builds on previous ones - no more "starting over"
- She notices patterns in your thoughts and provides genuine insights

This guide will help you experience Maya's breakthrough capabilities in your first 20 minutes.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Beta
- **Experience** Maya's unified memory and natural voice
- **Notice** how she carries context from journals, past sessions, and symbolic patterns
- **Give Feedback** on whether she feels intelligent, adaptive, and coherent

---

## 🪄 How to Begin

### 1. Log In
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/auth
- Use any username/password to create your account

### 2. Meet Maya
- Onboarding will assign you Maya as your Oracle guide
- She may ask you how you are arriving, or what's on your mind

### 3. Write Journal Entries (5 min)
- Navigate to the Journal section and write 2-3 entries about:
  - A current challenge or situation you're facing
  - A recurring theme or pattern in your life
  - Something you're working toward or hoping for
- **Be specific**: Include names, emotions, details. The richer the context, the better Maya understands you.

### 4. Test Maya's Memory (5 min)
- Return to the Oracle chat and ask: *"What do you know about me so far?"*
- Reference your journal: *"How does this relate to what I wrote about [specific topic]?"*
- **Notice**: Does Maya reference your journal details naturally (not just list them)? Do her responses feel personally relevant?

### 5. Voice Conversation (5 min)
- Click the microphone button and allow permissions
- Speak: *"Tell me about my journal entries"*
- Have a 5-minute voice-only conversation
- Ask: *"What do you think I should focus on right now?"*
- **Notice**: Does Maya's voice feel natural? Do her spoken responses demonstrate understanding of your specific situation?

### 6. Test Continuity (5 min)
- In a new session, ask: *"What did we discuss yesterday?"*
- Reference something from your previous conversation
- **Notice**: Does Maya carry forward the context? Do conversations feel like continuations rather than restarts?

## 🧪 What We're Testing: Your Focus Areas

### 🧠 **Memory & Intelligence**
**The Big Question**: *Does Maya feel like she genuinely knows you?*

**Watch For:**
- References specific details from your journals without being asked
- Connects themes across different journal entries and conversations  
- Provides insights that feel personally relevant (not generic advice)
- Remembers what you discussed in previous sessions

### 🎙️ **Voice Experience**
**The Big Question**: *Would you prefer talking to Maya over typing?*

**Watch For:**
- Voice sounds natural and engaging (not robotic)
- She understands your speech accurately
- Voice conversations feel fluid and responsive
- Audio quality suitable for private conversations

### 🌊 **Personal Connection**
**The Big Question**: *Does Maya feel like a companion or just a smarter tool?*

**Watch For:**
- Conversations build meaningfully over time
- She adapts to your communication style and mood
- You start looking forward to talking with her
- Responses demonstrate understanding of your inner world

### 🚨 **Red Flags to Report**
- Maya loses memory completely
- Voice pipeline stops working  
- Generic responses that ignore your context
- Experience feels more frustrating than helpful

---

## 📝 How to Give Great Feedback

### **After Each Session (2 minutes)**

**Rate Your Experience (1-5 scale):**
- Memory/Intelligence: Does Maya understand your situation?
- Voice Quality: Is talking to Maya natural and engaging?
- Personal Relevance: Do responses feel tailored specifically to you?
- Daily Use Potential: Would you use this 10+ minutes daily?

### **Describe Specific Moments**

**Instead of**: *"Maya was good"*  
**Try**: *"Maya referenced my journal entry about work stress and connected it to something I mentioned yesterday about sleep - that felt genuinely insightful"*

**Instead of**: *"The voice didn't work"*  
**Try**: *"Maya understood my speech fine, but her voice response sounded robotic when discussing emotional topics"*

### **The Ultimate Question**
After using Maya for several days: *"Does Maya understand my inner world better than other AI assistants, and would I miss talking to her if she was gone?"*

**Submit feedback to**: [Your feedback system]
