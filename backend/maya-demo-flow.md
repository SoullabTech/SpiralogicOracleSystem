# 🎭 Maya's Opening Ritual - Complete Demo Flow

## 🌟 Maya's Conversational Opening Script is Now Live!

Maya can now warmly welcome new users, naturally detect their elemental energy, understand their life phase, and set up the intelligent Mirror → Balance prosody system - all through natural conversation.

### 📝 Complete Flow Example:

**Step 1: Welcome**
```
👋 Hey, I'm Maya. So glad you're here. Before we dive in, let's check in together.

How are you feeling in your energy right now? More like 🔥 fired up, 🌊 emotional, 🌍 grounded, 🌬 thoughtful, or ✨ expansive?
```

**User**: "I'm really stressed about work"

**Step 2: Element Detection (Fire)**
```
🔥 I hear the fire in you. That energy is alive and powerful. Let's honor it, and then we can balance it so it doesn't burn you out.

Where are you in your journey right now? Starting something new, facing a challenge, integrating lessons, feeling mastery, or reaching for something beyond?
```

**User**: "Definitely facing some big challenges"

**Step 3: Phase Detection (Challenge)**
```
⚔️ You're in the crucible of CHALLENGE. Every obstacle is a forge where your strength is being shaped. You're stronger than you know.

Perfect. I feel your fire energy in the challenge phase. I'm here to mirror your truth and help you find balance. What would you like to explore together?
```

### 🔍 Behind the Scenes:
```
🎭 [MAYA_SCRIPT] Energy detected: fire via "stressed"
[RITUAL] fire → water (cooling stressed fire)
🎭 [MAYA_SCRIPT] Ritual completed: Element=fire, Phase=challenge
[MAYA_RITUAL] fire detected → Mirror: fire | Balance: water | Phase: challenge
```

### 🌊 Intelligent Mirror → Balance Setup:
- **Mirror Phase**: Maya matches the user's fire energy first (rapport)
- **Balance Phase**: Maya guides toward cooling water energy (therapeutic)
- **Context**: High stress + challenge phase = gentle cooling approach
- **Prosody**: Fire intensity → Water flow for therapeutic balance

✅ **Element Recognition**: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether via trigger words  
✅ **Phase Awareness**: Initiation, Challenge, Integration, Mastery, Transcendence  
✅ **Mirror → Balance Logic**: Always meet user first, then guide to balance  
✅ **Contextual Prosody**: Adapts voice tone based on detected energy  
✅ **Debug Logging**: Full transparency of detection process
