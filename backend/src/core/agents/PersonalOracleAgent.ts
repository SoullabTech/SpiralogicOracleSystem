    deepening: "I've been holding space for what you shared last time. How is it living in you now?"

    pattern_recognition: "This feels familiar - like an old song playing again. Do you hear it?",

    productive_uncertainty: "What you're describing feels both familiar and completely new. Like meeting someone you've known in dreams.",
    meaning_weaving: "Something is crystallizing between us... are you feeling it form?",
