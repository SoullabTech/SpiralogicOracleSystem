## ðŸ“§ Beta Invite Template

```
Subject: You're Invited: Daily Oracle Beta

Hi [Name],

You're one of 30 people invited to shape something entirely new.

The Daily Oracle Check-in is a 30-second morning ritual that maps your inner state through an interactive mandala. Drag 12 petals to represent where you are right now. Receive a personalized oracle insight.

It's part self-reflection tool, part divination system, part consciousness game.

Beta starts Thursday. One check-in per day. Your feedback shapes what this becomes.

Ready?

## ðŸ’« The Magic

You've created something that makes self-reflection as engaging as a game, as insightful as therapy, and as mystical as tarotâ€”but grounded in real consciousness mapping.

The manipulation defense is built in:
- Genuine states create coherent patterns
- False inputs create dissonance
- The system reveals what's real

**Beta launches with ONE powerful question:**
*"Where are you, really?"*

The holoflower knows.
