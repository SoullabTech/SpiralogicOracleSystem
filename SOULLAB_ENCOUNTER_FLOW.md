## 🌟 First Encounter - Setting the Sacred Container

### 1. Welcome Screen (Before Chat)
```
Welcome to Soullab 🧪

This isn't therapy. It isn't advice.
This is your life laboratory.

You are the experiment.
Maya is your lab assistant.
Life is where discovery happens.

Ready to begin?
[Enter the Lab]
```

### 2. First Message from Maya
```
"Welcome. I'm Maya — not your teacher, not your therapist, 
just your witness and lab assistant.

We'll have a brief exchange (3-4 messages), 
clarify an experiment for you to run in life, 
then you'll go live it.

What experiment wants to run through you today?"
```

### Exchange 4: Return to Life
