# Maya Beta Testing Checklist
## Response Mode Tracking

### For Each Maya Response, Mark:

**Response Mode Used:**
- [ ] Mirror - Reflected user's words with optional context
- [ ] Nudge - Asked one guiding question  
- [ ] Integrate - Connected with past themes/memory
- [ ] MIXED (error - report if modes were mixed)
- [ ] UNCLEAR (error - report if mode wasn't clear)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Response was 1-3 sentences max
- [ ] Tone was professional, not therapeutic/mystical
- [ ] If memory was used, it felt natural not forced
- [ ] Response stayed focused on user's actual words

**Memory Usage (if applicable):**
- [ ] Recent journal reference
- [ ] Pattern/theme recognition
- [ ] Long-term memory callback
- [ ] Profile/archetype reference
- [ ] Elemental perspective (should be subtle)

## Failure Patterns to Watch For

### Red Flags:
- [ ] Response over 3 sentences
- [ ] Multiple questions in one response
- [ ] Therapy-speak ("I hear you saying...", "It sounds like...")
- [ ] Mystical language ("The universe is...", "Your soul knows...")
- [ ] Mixing modes (reflecting AND questioning AND integrating)
- [ ] Making assumptions not in user's words
- [ ] Generic motivational quotes

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Single word inputs ("tired", "angry", "confused")
- Stream of consciousness rambling
- Direct questions to Maya
- Requests for specific elemental perspectives
- Crisis/urgent emotional states

## Quick Validation Script

For each response, ask:
1. Can I clearly identify which ONE mode was used?
2. Would this fit in a text message (brevity test)?
3. Does it sound like a thoughtful friend, not a therapist?
4. If memory was referenced, was it specific and relevant?

**Target Success Rate:** 90% clear mode identification, 95% length compliance, 100% no therapy-speak
