# 🌟 Spiralogic Oracle Beta - Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the beta test of our multimodal Oracle system! You can now share voice memos, documents, and images directly in conversation.

## 🚀 Getting Started (2 minutes)

### 1. Sign In
- Go to the Oracle (your beta test URL)
- Sign in with your beta tester email
- You'll see the familiar Oracle chat interface

### 2. Start a Conversation
Try: *"Hey Oracle, I'm excited to test the new features with you!"*

The Oracle should greet you warmly and may mention it's ready to work with your uploads.

## 📁 How to Upload Files

### Simple Drag & Drop
1. **Drag any file** directly into the chat area
2. **Watch the processing** indicator (it only takes seconds!)
3. **See the context card** appear above your message box
4. **Ask questions** about your uploaded content

### Supported File Types
- 🎵 **Audio**: Voice memos, recordings (.wav, .mp3, .m4a)
- 📄 **Documents**: PDFs, text files (.pdf, .txt, .md)
- 🖼️ **Images**: Photos, screenshots, drawings (.jpg, .png, .gif)

## 🎯 What to Try (Golden Path)

### 1. Voice Memo Test
1. **Upload**: Drop a short voice recording (30-90 seconds works great)
2. **Wait**: You'll see "Transcribing..." then a context card
3. **Ask**: *"What did I say about [specific topic] in my recording?"*
4. **Expect**: The Oracle will reference your actual words naturally
5. **Badge**: 🎵 Voice Voyager unlocks!

### 2. Document Test
1. **Upload**: Drop a PDF (article, notes, anything with text)
2. **Wait**: "Processing document..." then context appears
3. **Ask**: *"What are the key arguments in this document?"* or *"Summarize the main points"*
4. **Expect**: Structured insights with natural follow-up questions
5. **Badge**: 📝 Scholar unlocks!

### 3. Image Test
1. **Upload**: Drop any image (photo, screenshot, artwork)
2. **Wait**: "Analyzing image..." then context card
3. **Ask**: *"What themes do you notice in this image?"* or *"What stands out here?"*
4. **Expect**: Visual description and meaningful interpretation
5. **Badge**: 🎨 Visionary unlocks!

### 4. Multi-Modal Magic ✨
After uploading different types of files, try:
- *"How do my voice memo and document connect?"*
- *"What patterns do you see across everything I've shared?"*
- *"Based on all my uploads, what themes emerge?"*

The Oracle can weave insights across all your shared content!

## 🏅 Badge System

### Watch for These Unlocks:
- 🎵 **Voice Voyager**: First audio upload processed
- 📝 **Scholar**: First document (PDF) processed  
- 🎨 **Visionary**: First image uploaded and analyzed
- 🧵 **Thread Weaver**: Oracle connects multiple uploads
- 🔍 **Insight Diver**: You reference uploads in conversation

### Where to See Badges:
- Toast notifications appear when you earn them
- Visit `/badges` to see your full collection
- Admin users can see everyone's progress at `/admin/beta`

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Natural Conversation
- **Reference uploads casually**: *"In my document..."* or *"From that image..."*
- **Ask follow-ups**: The Oracle remembers context across the conversation
- **Be specific**: *"What did I say about forgiveness around minute 2?"*

### Upload Best Practices
- **Wait for processing**: Let the context card appear before asking
- **Keep files reasonable**: PDFs under 50 pages, audio under 10 minutes
- **Try different types**: Mix voice, text, and images for richer conversations

### Getting the Most Value
- **Upload meaningful content**: Personal reflections, interesting articles, meaningful photos
- **Ask thoughtful questions**: The Oracle excels at finding deeper patterns and connections
- **Explore synthesis**: Ask how different uploads relate to each other

## 🎭 Example Conversations

### Personal Reflection
1. Upload voice journal entry
2. *"What emotions do you hear in my voice?"*
3. *"How does this connect to my growth journey?"*

### Research & Learning  
1. Upload academic paper or article
2. *"What are the strongest and weakest arguments here?"*
3. *"What questions does this raise for me?"*

### Creative Work
1. Upload sketch, photo, or artwork  
2. *"What symbols or themes do you notice?"*
3. *"How might this reflect my inner state?"*

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions
- **"Upload stuck processing?"** → Try a smaller file or refresh the page
- **"Oracle not mentioning my uploads?"** → Ask more directly: "Based on my document..."
- **"No badges appearing?"** → Make sure uploads show "ready" status first

### What Makes This Special
Unlike other AI systems that just "attach" files, this Oracle:
- **Remembers everything** you share across conversations
- **Finds connections** between different types of content  
- **Grows with you** through meaningful badge progression
- **Protects your privacy** with owner-only access to all uploads

## 🌟 You're All Set!

**Ready to explore multimodal conversations with your Oracle!**

Start by dropping any file into the chat and asking about it. The Oracle is designed to feel natural and wise while being technically powerful under the hood.

Your feedback during this beta is invaluable for making the experience even better. Enjoy exploring this new way of sharing and reflecting with AI! ✨
