## Start in 3 Steps

### 1. Choose Your Element

How does this moment feel?

| Element | When to Choose |
|---------|----------------|
| 🔥 **Fire** | Transformation, passion, urgency |
| 💧 **Water** | Emotion, healing, flow |
| 🌍 **Earth** | Grounding, body, stability |
| 🌬️ **Air** | Clarity, thought, perspective |
| ✨ **Aether** | Spirit, mystery, emergence |

**No wrong choice—trust what feels true right now.**

### 2. Press & Speak

- Tap the microphone
- Speak for 2-10 minutes
- No script needed—just what's alive

**Voice commands:**
- "Pause, Maya" to pause
- "Okay, Maya" to resume

---

### 3. Receive MAIA's Reflection

MAIA will mirror back:
- **Symbols** you spoke (ocean, doorway, fire)
- **Archetypes** present (Hero, Shadow, Seeker)
- **Your spiral phase** (descent, transformation, emergence)
- **Elemental state** and intensity

**This becomes part of your Soulprint—your living map of transformation.**

## Tips for Powerful Sessions

✅ **Start with a feeling**: "I've been feeling restless..."
✅ **Follow symbolic threads**: "It's like standing at a threshold..."
✅ **Don't edit yourself**: Your voice knows what to say
✅ **Honor silence**: Pauses are sacred
✅ **End with breath**: Let the session settle

## Privacy

✓ Your voice data is encrypted
✓ Audio transcribed then discarded (unless you save it)
✓ Export everything (Obsidian, PDF, JSON)
✓ Full data sovereignty—you own your consciousness

**MAIA reflects, never diagnoses or prescribes.**
