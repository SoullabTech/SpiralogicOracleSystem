## How Voice Journaling Works

### Speaking

1. **Press the microphone button** to start recording
2. **Speak naturally** ‚Äî no script needed
3. **Pause anytime** by saying "Pause, Maya" or clicking pause
4. **Resume** by saying "Okay, Maya" or clicking resume
5. **Stop** when you're complete

### What MAIA Hears

MAIA listens for:
- **Symbols** ‚Äî Recurring images and metaphors (ocean, mountain, doorway)
- **Archetypes** ‚Äî Energetic patterns (Hero, Shadow, Seeker, Healer)
- **Emotional tone** ‚Äî The feeling beneath the words
- **Spiral phase** ‚Äî Where you are in your developmental journey
- **Transformation potential** ‚Äî What's trying to emerge

### MAIA's Reflection

After you speak, MAIA will:
- **Mirror** the essence of what you shared
- **Reflect** patterns she notices
- **Ask** gentle, opening questions
- **Hold space** without fixing or advising

**Remember**: MAIA doesn't give advice. She reflects what you already know but cannot yet see.

## Best Practices

### Create Sacred Space

Before you begin:
- Find a quiet, private place
- Take three deep breaths
- Set an intention (even silently)
- Give yourself permission to be unfiltered

### Speak Without Editing

The voice is raw soul. Don't:
- Plan what you'll say
- Self-censor or polish
- Worry about being "profound"
- Force coherence

Just speak what's alive right now.

### Honor the Pauses

Silence is not empty‚Äîit's where emergence happens. If you pause mid-thought, that's okay. MAIA holds the space.

### Trust the Process

You may not know what you're saying until you hear yourself say it. That's the magic of voice journaling.
