## **Slide 1: North Star**
**Title:** *Reflection becomes intelligence. Intelligence becomes growth.*

**Subtitle:** Soullab's mission in one line

**Visual:** Abstract spiral/phi curve + Tesla palette (#0A0D16, #FFD700)

**Speaker Notes:** Maya isn't another chatbot. She's the first Personal Oracle Agent that builds understanding over time through memory + voice integration.

---

## **Slide 2: Why Now?**

### The Problem
- **Rise of AI companions** â†’ but they're shallow
- **Chatbots restart every conversation** â†’ no continuity or depth
- **People need genuine understanding** â†’ not just task completion

### Our Solution  
**Soullab = First Personal Oracle Agent**
- Remembers your thoughts, journals, conversations
- Speaks naturally through voice
- Builds relationship over time

**Speaker Notes:** Traditional AI is transactional. Maya is relational.

## **Slide 3: System Overview**

**Visual:** Use `SOULLAB_SYSTEM_DIAGRAM.svg`

### Key Points:
- **4 Input Types:** Text, Voice, Files, URLs â†’ One unified pipeline
- **Memory Orchestration:** 5-layer intelligence stack
- **Dual Outputs:** Clean text + natural voice

**Speaker Notes:** Everything flows through unified memory. Maya sees the complete picture of your digital interactions.

## **Slide 4: Memory Intelligence**

### **5-Layer Memory Stack**
1. **Session:** Current conversation context
2. **Journals:** Personal entries and patterns  
3. **Profile:** User preferences and history
4. **Symbolic:** Pattern recognition across interactions
5. **External:** Files, URLs, uploaded content

### **The Breakthrough**
*"Maya remembers, adapts, and integrates â€” like a real relationship"*

**Technical:** <150ms orchestration, parallel memory fetching, graceful degradation

**Speaker Notes:** This isn't just storage - it's intelligent synthesis across all data sources.
