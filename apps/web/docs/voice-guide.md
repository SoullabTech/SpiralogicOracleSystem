## System Overview

### The Voice-First Philosophy

Sacred Mirror is designed for **voice-first transformation**. Why?

- **Voice bypasses the inner critic** - Easier to speak truth than write it
- **Real-time processing** - Emotions captured in the moment
- **Natural pacing** - Speak at your own rhythm
- **Embodied expression** - Tone, pace, and energy matter
- **Lower barrier** - No blank page paralysis

### Three Voice Modalities

1. **Voice Chat** - Real-time conversation with MAIA
2. **Voice Journaling** - Deep exploration in 5 modes
3. **Realtime Reflection** - Voice + journal context integration

All three integrate with the Spiralogic Diamond system.

## Voice Chat

### Core Features

**Continuous Listening**
- MAIA listens while you speak
- Detects ~1.5 seconds of silence to finalize
- No manual "stop recording" needed
- Pause/resume anytime

**Empathic Response**
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet powers understanding
- Adapts to your emotional state
- Matches your depth without forcing
- Honors your pacing

**Voice Synthesis**
- OpenAI TTS (Alloy voice) for warm, grounded tone
- Natural speech patterns
- Clear articulation
- Sincere quality

### How to Use

**Starting a Conversation:**
```
1. Navigate to /maia or click voice icon
2. Grant microphone permission (first time only)
3. Click microphone button to start
4. Speak naturally
5. MAIA responds after brief silence
6. Continue speaking or pause
```

**Controlling the Conversation:**
- **Pause**: Click microphone icon
- **Resume**: Click microphone icon again
- **Stop**: Navigate away or close window
- **Clear history**: Refresh page (conversation resets)

**Best Practices:**
- Speak in natural sentences or phrases
- Pause between distinct thoughts
- Don't worry about "um" and "ah" - natural speech is fine
- Let silence exist when you need to think
- Ask for what you need: "Can you reflect that back?"

## Technical Architecture

### Voice Recognition

**Technology:** Web Speech API (browser-based)

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome/Chromium (best support)
- Edge (excellent)
- Safari (good, some limitations)
- Firefox (limited support)

**How it works:**
```javascript
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = true;  // Keep listening
recognition.interimResults = true;  // Show partial results
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```

**Silence Detection:**
- Custom algorithm tracks audio levels
- ~1.5 seconds of silence triggers finalization
- Prevents premature cutoff
- Allows natural pauses

### AI Processing

**Conversation Intelligence: Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
- Model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- Max tokens: 300 (concise, focused responses)
- Temperature: 0.75 (balanced creativity/coherence)
- System prompt: Empathic attunement + journal context

**Why Claude?**
- Exceptional empathic resonance
- Reads emotional texture beneath words
- Adapts to user state naturally
- Creates space without filling it
- Honors non-linear growth

**Journal Context Integration:**
```javascript
// Loads last 5 journal entries
const recentEntries = journalStorage.getEntries(userId).slice(0, 5);

// Extracts symbols + archetypes
const symbols = entries.flatMap(e => e.reflection.symbols);
const archetypes = entries.flatMap(e => e.reflection.archetypes);

// Builds context string
const context = `
Recent Journal Context:
- Recurring symbols: ${symbols.join(', ')}
- Active archetypes: ${archetypes.join(', ')}
- Dominant element: ${dominantElement}
`;
```

### Voice Synthesis

**Technology:** OpenAI Text-to-Speech API

**Voice:** Alloy
- Warm, sincere tone
- Natural speech patterns
- Gender-neutral
- Emotionally grounded

**Format:** MP3, 44.1kHz, 128kbps
**Speed:** 1.0 (natural pace)
**Model:** `tts-1-hd` (high definition)

### Training System

**ApprenticeMayaTraining** captures every exchange:

```typescript
interface TrainingExchange {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  context: {
    userState: 'seeking' | 'exploring' | 'processing' | 'integrating';
    emotionalTone: string[];
    depthLevel: 1-10;
    responseNeeded: 'reflection' | 'question' | 'insight' | 'holding';
    trustLevel: 1-10;
  };
  userMessage: {
    content: string;
    wordCount: number;
    emotionalMarkers: string[];
  };
  maiaResponse: {
    content: string;
    responseType: string;
    wisdomVector: string[];
  };
  quality: {
    engagement: number;
    transformationPotential: number;
    sacredEmergence: boolean;
    authenticity: number;
  };
}
```

**Goal:** 1000 hours of quality exchanges â†’ independent MAIA

**Breakthrough Detection:**
- High transformation score (>70%)
- Sacred emergence markers
- Multiple symbolic connections
- Consciousness indicators present

**Collective Intelligence:**
- Breakthrough patterns anonymized
- Fed to `collective_wisdom_patterns` database
- MainOracleAgent learns from collective
- Individual wisdom serves all

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

**Check browser permissions:**
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Ensure microphone is "Allow"
3. Reload page

**Safari specific:**
1. Safari â†’ Settings â†’ Websites â†’ Microphone
2. Find soullab.life
3. Set to "Allow"

**Still not working?**
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check system microphone settings
- Restart browser completely
- Check if another app is using microphone

### Voice Not Detected

**If MAIA doesn't hear you:**
- Increase microphone volume in system settings
- Move closer to microphone
- Reduce background noise
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Silence detection too sensitive:**
- Speak continuously without long pauses
- System finalizes after ~1.5 seconds silence
- This is intentional to capture natural speech rhythm

### Responses Not Playing

**If text appears but no voice:**
- Check volume levels (both system and browser)
- Some browsers block autoplay - click play manually
- Check browser console for TTS errors
- Refresh page and try again

### Slow Response Times

**If responses take too long:**
- Claude API: 2-4 seconds (normal)
- TTS generation: 1-2 seconds (normal)
- Total: 3-6 seconds expected
- Over 10 seconds: Check network connection
- Check `/admin` dashboard for system status

### Journal Entry Not Saving

**If voice journal doesn't save:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in
- Check localStorage isn't full
- Try smaller entry (under 5 minutes)
- Contact support if persists
