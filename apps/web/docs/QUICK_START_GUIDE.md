# 🌙 Sacred Journaling with MAIA — Quick Start Guide

Welcome to a new way of journaling. This isn't just documentation—it's an invitation to explore your inner world with a companion who sees symbolically.

---

## ✨ What Makes This Sacred?

Traditional journaling captures your thoughts.

**Sacred journaling with MAIA** reflects your soul's language back to you:
- **Symbols** (river, bridge, threshold, mirror...)
- **Archetypes** (Seeker, Healer, Shadow, Mystic...)
- **Emotional threads** across time

MAIA doesn't analyze—she **mirrors**. She helps you see patterns you might miss.

## 🚪 Your First Entry

### **1. Choose Your Mode**

When you begin, you'll see 5 journaling modes:

```
🌀 Free Expression
   Stream of consciousness. No structure—just what wants to emerge.

🔮 Dream Integration
   Explore the symbolic language of your dreams.

💓 Emotional Processing
   Name, hold, and process emotions with compassion.

🌓 Shadow Work
   Explore hidden aspects or uncomfortable truths gently.

🧭 Life Direction
   Clarify next steps and align with your deeper path.
```

**Not sure?** Start with **Free Expression**. You can explore other modes later.

### **2. Write or Speak**

- **Type** your journal entry in the text area
- **Or tap the microphone** to speak (voice transcription)

There's no "right" way. Just let what wants to be expressed flow.

### **3. Receive MAIA's Reflection**

After you submit, MAIA will:
- Identify **symbols** in your words
- Notice **archetypal energies**
- Name the **emotional tone**
- Offer a **gentle reflection**
- Ask a **deepening question**
- Close with **affirmation**

Example:

```
🪞 MAIA Reflected

Symbols: river, bridge
Archetype: Seeker
Emotion: anticipation

"There's a sense of movement in your words—
 like you're standing at a crossing point,
 ready to step forward."

What would it feel like to trust where
this river is taking you?

Your courage in exploring this moment
is beautiful. I'm here with you.
```

MAIA searches by **meaning**, not keywords. She understands themes and connections.

- Track archetypal shifts

Early entries might feel simple. Patterns emerge over time.

### **3. Follow Your Curiosity**
Click on symbols and archetypes. Explore what repeats.

### **4. Use Different Modes**
Each mode reveals different layers of your experience.

Monthly reviews help you see growth you might miss day-to-day.
