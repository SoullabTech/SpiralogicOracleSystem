# ✅ Onboarding Tone Analytics Implementation Complete

## 🎯 System Overview

The complete onboarding tone analytics system has been implemented to validate whether the tone detection and bias decay arc feel natural, supportive, and effective in early user sessions.

## 📊 Analytics Events Implemented

### 1. `onboarding.tone_feedback.submitted`
Emitted when users provide feedback on Sessions 1, 4, or 8
- **Captures**: User tone selection, custom feedback, system prediction, bias application, resonance score
- **Purpose**: Validate tone detection accuracy and user satisfaction

### 2. `onboarding.bias_decay.evaluated`  
Emitted automatically during onboarding sessions (1-10)
- **Captures**: Detected tone, decay factor, active bias deltas, progression stability
- **Purpose**: Track bias decay curve and ensure smooth evolution

### 3. `onboarding.tone_feedback.mismatch`
Emitted when user feedback significantly differs from system prediction
- **Captures**: Predicted vs reported tone, mismatch severity, adjustment recommendations
- **Purpose**: Identify calibration opportunities and system improvements

### 4. `onboarding.resonance.evaluated`
Emitted for overall relationship quality assessment
- **Captures**: Resonance index, tone accuracy, decay stability, satisfaction trend
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive onboarding effectiveness measurement

## 🧪 Beta Experiment Design

### Feedback Collection Points

**Session 1**: 
> "How did our conversation feel — gentle, curious, energizing, or neutral?"
- Options: curious, hesitant, enthusiastic, neutral
- Validates initial tone detection accuracy

**Session 4**:
> "I may be speaking a bit differently as we get to know each other. How does that feel to you?"
- Open-ended response
- Captures bias evolution naturalness

**Session 8**:
> "Do you feel the way I've been speaking with you has changed since we began?"
- Open-ended response  
- Validates overall relationship arc

### Success Metrics

✅ **≥75%** match between system-detected and user-reported first-tone
✅ **Smooth decay curve** showing gradual return to adaptive behavior by Session 10
✅ **Natural evolution** - users report vibe changes feel organic, not mechanical
✅ **No systematic bias** - no tone group reports consistent mismatch or discomfort

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **OracleStateMachineConfig** (`src/core/config/oracleStateMachine.config.ts`)
   - Declarative configuration for all Oracle behavior
   - Crisis override patterns and responses
   - Tone adaptation templates and thresholds
   - Stage-specific response templates

2. **OracleStateMachineManager** (`src/core/OracleStateMachineManager.ts`)
   - Unified filter application: crisis → onboarding → mastery
   - Tone detection and bias application with decay
   - Clean delegation from PersonalOracleAgent

3. **OnboardingFeedbackService** (`src/services/OnboardingFeedbackService.ts`)
   - Automated feedback prompt generation for Sessions 1, 4, 8
   - Resonance score calculation
   - Feedback theme extraction and insights

4. **Analytics Types** (`src/types/onboardingAnalytics.ts`)
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all events
   - Utility functions for mismatch detection and resonance scoring
   - Dashboard data structures

## 🔬 Testing Results

### System Validation Tests

**✅ Crisis Override Detection**: Correctly identifies crisis language and provides grounding responses
**✅ Tone Adaptation**: 
- Curious: "I hear your curiosity. Let's start where your question points:"
- Hesitant: "It sounds like you're feeling tentative. We can go gently."  
- Enthusiastic: "I can feel your energy! Let's dive in."
- Neutral: "Let's begin simply, with what's present for you:"

**✅ Feedback Collection**: Automatic prompt generation and formatting for Oracle responses
**✅ Analytics Pipeline**: Complete event emission with proper payload structures
**✅ Configuration System**: Declarative config successfully drives all behavior

### Sample Analytics Output

```json
{
  "eventName": "onboarding.tone_feedback.submitted",
  "data": {
    "userId": "test_user_123",
    "sessionCount": 1,
    "systemPredictedTone": "curious", 
    "userToneSelection": "curious",
    "resonanceScore": 1.0,
    "biasApplied": {
      "trustDelta": 0.18,
      "decayFactor": 0.9
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Production Ready

The system provides:

- **Real-time Analytics**: Every onboarding interaction generates rich analytics data
- **Automatic Feedback Collection**: No manual intervention required for Sessions 1, 4, 8
- **Mismatch Detection**: Automatic alerts when tone prediction accuracy drops
- **Dashboard Ready**: All events include dashboard-friendly payloads
- **A/B Test Ready**: Easy configuration changes for testing different approaches

## 📈 Dashboard Visualizations Ready

1. **Bias Decay Curves**: Line charts showing trust/challenge/humor progression over sessions
2. **Tone Accuracy Heatmaps**: System predictions vs user reports by session
3. **Resonance Trends**: Overall satisfaction and naturalness scores over time  
4. **Cohort Analysis**: Tone distribution and retention rates across user groups
5. **Feedback Themes**: Common patterns in user custom responses

The complete system is production-ready and will provide comprehensive validation of whether the onboarding tone detection and bias decay creates natural, supportive relationships that evolve authentically over time. ✨
