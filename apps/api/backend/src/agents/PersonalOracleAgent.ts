/**
 * Four Focal Points Framework - Universal Intelligence Architecture
 *
 * A timeless practitioner framework that naturally harmonizes with:
 * - Jungian Shadow Work (IDEAL/SHADOW integration)
 * - Solution-Focused Therapy (RESOURCES orientation)
 * - Ericksonian Hypnosis (OUTCOME through deeper-self access)
 * - Elemental Alchemy (all four points through elemental expression)
 * - Gestalt Therapy (present-moment awareness across all points)
 * - Transpersonal Psychology (SERVICE dimension in OUTCOME)
 *
 * The Four Points are archetypal inquiry dimensions that appear
 * across traditions because they map to how consciousness naturally
 * organizes and evolves. Universal yet infinitely adaptable.
 *
 * 1. IDEAL - Vision, aspiration, what wants to emerge
 * 2. SHADOW - Challenges, resistance, what needs acknowledgment
 * 3. RESOURCES - Strengths, capacities, what's available and needed
 * 4. OUTCOME - Transformation desire, magical result, service to world
