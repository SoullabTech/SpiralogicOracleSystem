console.log('  • Dynamic confidence thresholds based on emotional state');
console.log('  • Emotional intensity tracking for better attunement');
console.log('  • Breakthrough detection for celebration moments');
console.log('  • Memory + active listening integration');
console.log('  • Neurodivergent validation with priority interruption');
console.log('  • Frustration detection with adaptive reset');
console.log('  • Body-emotion-topic weaving across conversation turns');
console.log('  • Progressive depth based on memory accumulation');

console.log('\n🎯 Expected Quality Improvements:');
console.log('  • From 65-70% baseline to 75-80% target quality');
console.log('  • Active listening techniques properly matched to user needs');
console.log('  • Memory recalls create continuity and depth');
console.log('  • Contextual adjustments prevent frustration loops');
console.log('  • Breakthrough moments are recognized and amplified');
