# Mindfulness

Mindfulness means bringing full awareness to the present moment.
It trains attention, softens judgment, and creates inner spaciousness.

## Core Principles

The essence of mindfulness practice includes:
- **Present moment awareness** - anchoring attention in the here and now
- **Non-judgmental observation** - witnessing experiences without labeling them as good or bad
- **Gentle acceptance** - allowing what is to be, without forcing change
- **Compassionate curiosity** - approaching inner experience with kindness

## Daily Integration

Simple ways to weave mindfulness into ordinary moments:
- Three conscious breaths before meals
- Mindful walking between appointments  
- Pausing to notice sensations during routine tasks
- Observing thoughts like clouds passing through the sky

## The Spaciousness Within

Regular practice creates a sense of inner space - room to respond rather than react, space to choose our relationship with whatever arises.
