echo "✅ Key Integration Points Verified:"
echo "  • Context building includes upload attachments"
echo "  • Turn route passes upload context to Claude"
echo "  • Upload references are detected in user messages"
echo "  • Beta events track upload usage"
echo "  • MessageComposer shows recent uploads"

echo "🔍 To fully verify integration:"
echo "  1. Upload a file through the UI"
echo "  2. Ask a question referencing the upload"
echo "  3. Check if Oracle's response incorporates the upload content"
echo "  4. Verify beta events in the database"
