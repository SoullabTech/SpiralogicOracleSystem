### ✅ **5. Unified CI Endpoint**
**File**: `app/api/sesame/ci/shape/route.ts`  
**Achievement**: Single point of Sesame access with built-in intelligence
- **Hybrid manager integration**: Uses intelligent endpoint selection
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when endpoints fail
- **Performance headers**: Response time and source tracking  
- **GET endpoint**: Health status checking capability

### ✅ **6. Maya Integration**
**File**: `app/api/oracle/personal/route.ts`  
**Achievement**: Seamless Sacred Voice Technology in Maya's personality
- **Enhanced pipeline**: Claude → Sesame CI → Response Enhancement → TTS
- **Fallback protection**: Maya never breaks, even during complete outages
- **Performance logging**: Detailed metrics for optimization
- **Personality preservation**: Maya's character maintained throughout
