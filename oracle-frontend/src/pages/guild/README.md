# 🛡 Spiralogic Guild – Contributor DAO Portal

This folder contains the symbolic DAO scaffolding for Spiralogic’s community governance and contributor growth.

---

## 🌀 Philosophy

Spiralogic treats governance as ritual and growth as collaborative evolution. It is not tokenized, competitive, or corporate — it is relational, archetypal, and soul-aware.
