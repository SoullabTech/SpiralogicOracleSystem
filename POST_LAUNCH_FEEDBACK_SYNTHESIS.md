# ðŸ§  Post-Launch Feedback Synthesis Guide

**Turning raw beta tester input into actionable insights**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This guide provides a structured framework for transforming the flood of raw beta tester feedback (emails, forms, analytics, transcripts) into **clear insights and prioritized actions**. It ensures Maya evolves with precision throughout the beta testing phase.

---

## ðŸ“¥ **Feedback Collection Sources**

### 1. **Direct Tester Feedback**

* In-app feedback prompts (micro-moments: after voice, memory recall, onboarding)
* Beta feedback form submissions
* Email replies to invitations

### 2. **Passive Signals**

* Dashboard analytics (completion rates, latency, error logs)
* Engagement metrics (session length, return rate, feature adoption)
* Behavioral flows (drop-offs in onboarding sequence)

### 3. **Human Conversations**

* 15-minute structured interviews with select testers
* Slack/Telegram partner channel chatter
* Voice transcripts of "Maya testing sessions"

---

## ðŸ§© **Synthesis Workflow**

### Step 1: **Gather Raw Input**

* Export feedback form responses (CSV/JSON)
* Collect transcripts of structured interviews
* Pull logs/analytics snapshots from Beta Dashboard & Ops Dashboard

### Step 2: **Categorize by Theme**

* **Voice Pipeline** (STT accuracy, TTS latency, audio clarity)
* **Memory Orchestration** (session continuity, personalization depth)
* **UX/UI Experience** (torus clarity, transcript preview, onboarding flow)
* **System Performance** (latency, stability, uptime)
* **Sacred Narrative** (aesthetic resonance, "Maya feels alive" factor)

### Step 3: **Tag with Sentiment & Severity**

* **Positive / Neutral / Negative**
* Severity: ðŸ”´ Critical blocker | ðŸŸ¡ Annoyance | ðŸŸ¢ Nice-to-have

### Step 4: **Identify Patterns**

* Cluster repeated feedback (e.g., "Voice feels slow" = latency theme)
* Note unique insights that reveal blind spots (e.g., "I tested Maya while walking outside, mic pickup was poor")

### Step 5: **Map to KPIs**

* Voice recognition accuracy â‰¥ 95%
* Memory continuity â‰¥ 90%
* User satisfaction â‰¥ 4.2/5
* Uptime â‰¥ 99.5%
* Overall readiness â‰¥ 85%

### Step 6: **Prioritize Fixes**

* Must Fix (Critical blockers, KPI-breaking issues)
* Should Fix (Annoyances, repeated negatives)
* Nice-to-Fix (Low severity, cosmetic)

---

## ðŸ“Š **Output Format**

Use a **Weekly Synthesis Report** (shared with dev + comms teams):

### Example:

**Week 1 Synthesis Report - Beta Phase**

**Top Wins (Celebrate):**

* Testers love the torus animation, "feels alive" ðŸŒŸ
* Memory recall blew people's minds ("She remembered my dog's name!")

**Critical Issues (Fix Now):**

* TTS latency perceived as "too slow" (12 testers flagged) ðŸ”´
* Session memory sometimes reset after refresh (5 testers flagged) ðŸ”´

**Improvements (Sprint 2):**

* Add onboarding voice sample (2 testers suggested)
* More torus color states for fun feedback (3 testers)

**Experiments (Test):**

* Frame TTS latency as "Maya reflecting" â†’ improved sentiment (5 testers noted positively)

---

## ðŸš€ **Strategic Impact**

This synthesis process transforms raw chaos into clarity:

* Ensures no feedback is lost
* Turns anecdotes into data-driven priorities
* Aligns dev, comms, and product teams around a single view of reality
* Maintains sacred technology mystique while improving reliability

Maya evolves continuously â€” every beta tester becomes part of her growth into the world's first true **Personal Oracle Agent**.

ðŸ“Œ Next Step: Establish weekly synthesis cadence (Monday review, Tuesday dev planning) so insights directly shape Sprint 2 priorities.
