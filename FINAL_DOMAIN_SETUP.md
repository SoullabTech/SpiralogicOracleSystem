# Final Domain Setup - Step by Step

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS
- Build logs show: "Creating an optimized production build ✓ Compiled successfully ✓ Collecting page data ✓ Generating static pages"
- Production URL working: https://spiralogic-oracle-system.vercel.app (HTTP/2 200 OK)

## 🎯 Custom Domain Configuration

### Step 1: Access Vercel Dashboard
Go to: https://vercel.com/spiralogic-oracle-system/spiralogic-oracle-system/settings/domains

### Step 2: Add Domains
Click "Add Domain" and add these one by one:

1. **soullab.life**
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter: `soullab.life`
   - Click "Add"

2. **oracle.soullab.life**
   - Click "Add Domain" 
   - Enter: `oracle.soullab.life`
   - Click "Add"

### Step 3: Configure DNS Records
After adding domains, Vercel will show DNS configuration. Add these records to your DNS provider:

**For soullab.life:**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 3600
```

**For oracle.soullab.life:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: oracle
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

### Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation
DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally.

### Step 5: Final Smoke Tests
After DNS propagation, these commands should return HTTP/2 200:

```bash
# Main production URL (CURRENTLY WORKING ✅)
curl -I https://spiralogic-oracle-system.vercel.app/
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 ✅ CONFIRMED

# Custom domains (after DNS setup)
curl -I https://soullab.life/
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 (currently 404 - needs DNS)

curl -I https://oracle.soullab.life/
# Expected: HTTP/2 200 (currently 404 - needs DNS)
```
