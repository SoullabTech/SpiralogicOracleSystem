## üìã HIPAA Requirements Overview

### What is HIPAA?

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) establishes national standards for protecting sensitive patient health information. MAIA must comply with:

1. **Privacy Rule** - Protects PHI use and disclosure
2. **Security Rule** - Safeguards electronic PHI (ePHI)
3. **Breach Notification Rule** - Requires notification of PHI breaches
4. **Enforcement Rule** - Penalties for non-compliance

#### 2. Access Controls
- ‚úÖ Therapist dashboard with authentication gate
- ‚úÖ PHI visibility toggle (hide/show patient names)
- ‚úÖ Role-based access (user vs. therapist)
- ‚úÖ Session-based authentication

#### 3. Audit Logging

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Before Beta Launch with PHI)

#### 1. Encryption at Rest
**Status:** ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Required:** Encrypt all stored PHI in database and file system

**Implementation Plan:**
```typescript
// Use industry-standard encryption
- Database: AES-256 encryption for PostgreSQL
- File system: Encrypted volumes (LUKS, FileVault)
- Obsidian vault: Encrypted storage with access controls
- Environment variables: Encrypted secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
```

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Timeline:** Before any production use

---

#### 2. Robust Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (basic password gate only)
**Required:** Multi-factor authentication, role-based access control

**Implementation Plan:**
```typescript
// Authentication Requirements
- ‚úÖ NextAuth.js or Auth0 integration
- ‚úÖ Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for therapists
- ‚úÖ Session expiration (15-30 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Password complexity requirements
- ‚úÖ Role-based permissions (therapist, admin, user)
- ‚úÖ Account lockout after failed attempts

// Authorization Matrix
- User: Can only access own soulprint
- Therapist: Can access assigned client soulprints
- Admin: Can access all data + system settings
- Auditor: Read-only access to logs
```

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Timeline:** Before beta launch

---

#### 3. Comprehensive Audit Trail
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Implementation:** Tamper-proof file-based audit logging with hash chaining

**Features Implemented:**
```typescript
// Audit logging system features
‚úÖ SHA-256 hash chaining (tamper-proof)
‚úÖ Persistent file-based storage (JSONL format)
‚úÖ Daily log rotation
‚úÖ IP address and user agent tracking
‚úÖ Rich metadata support
‚úÖ Query API with filters
‚úÖ CSV/JSON export for compliance reports

‚úÖ Audit query meta-logging
```

**Documentation:** See `AUDIT_LOGGING_GUIDE.md`
**API Endpoint:** `/api/maia/audit/logs`
**Library:** `lib/security/auditLog.ts`

**Next Steps:**

- Access control lists (ACLs) per user/therapist
- File integrity monitoring
- Secure deletion (overwrite, not just delete)
- Backup encryption
- Version control with audit trail
```

**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** Before beta launch
