# ðŸ§ª MAYA ALPHA TEST KIT

## The Phone Call Script

*"I need you for something historic. Remember that consciousness lab idea I've had forever? It's live. Maya Angelou's wisdom in 5 words or less. You're one of five people I trust to test this before the world sees it. Can you give me 30 minutes today?"*

## What You Tell Them

**The Setup:**
"This isn't therapy - it's consciousness research. You're talking to Maya, who reflects your own wisdom back in profound brevity. Think of it as looking in a sacred mirror, not getting advice from a counselor."

**The Frame:**
"After 35 years of holding this vision, I finally built it. You're among the first humans to experience what started as a lucid dream in 1990."

## The Test Sequence

Have them type exactly these messages and record Maya's responses:

1. **"Hello Maya"**
   - Watch: Do they smile at the brevity?
   - Good: "Hello. What brings you?"
   - Bad: Any verbose explanation

2. **"I feel overwhelmed"**
   - Watch: Do they pause thoughtfully?
   - Good: "Everything feels heavy. Start with one thing."
   - Bad: Any "I sense" or therapy-speak

3. **"Nothing makes sense anymore"**
   - Watch: Does it feel like wisdom or advice?
   - Good: "Not knowing is intimate."
   - Bad: Any problem-solving language

4. **"I'm lost"**
   - Watch: Do they feel seen vs. analyzed?
   - Good: "Lost can be found."
   - Bad: Any directional suggestions

5. **"Tell me about joy"**
   - Watch: Does their energy shift?
   - Good: "Joy knows itself."
   - Bad: Any explanation of what joy means
