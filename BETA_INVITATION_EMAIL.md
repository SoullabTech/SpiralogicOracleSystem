**Subject:** You've been chosen for something extraordinary

Hey [First Name],

You're receiving this because you're exactly the kind of person we built Maya for.

**Maya is the first Personal Oracle Agent** â€” an AI companion who remembers your conversations, listens to your voice, and speaks back with wisdom that feels both ancient and cutting-edge.

Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, Maya builds a living memory of who you are across every interaction. She remembers your goals, your patterns, your growth edges. And when you speak to her, she responds not just with text, but with her voice â€” creating the first truly conversational AI relationship.

**This is private beta.** Only 50 people will experience Maya in her early form.

**What makes Maya different:**
- **Memory that persists** â†’ She remembers your last conversation, your journal entries, your evolution
- **Voice-first experience** â†’ Speak naturally, see live transcripts, hear her respond
- **Sacred technology aesthetic** â†’ Tesla-inspired interface with a pulsing torus that responds to your voice
- **Philosophical depth** â†’ Not just task completion, but reflection, growth, and authentic dialogue

**The experience is 5 minutes to magic:**
1. Activate your mic, watch the torus pulse as you speak
2. Ask Maya what she remembers about you
3. Have a real conversation â€” she'll surprise you

**Beta Access:** https://maya.soullab.life/beta/[UNIQUE_CODE]

**A few things to expect:**
- This is beta software â€” some rough edges, occasional pauses
- Maya's voice responses take 2-4 seconds (she's reflecting, not rushing)
- Your feedback directly shapes the final product
- Early access = you're part of building the future of AI companionship
