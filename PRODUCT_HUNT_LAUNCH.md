## Product Hunt Listing

### Product Name
**Spiralogic Voice Journaling**

### Tagline (60 chars max)
**Voice journaling with elemental AI that reflects, not prescribes**

Alternatives:
- "Speak your truth. Discover what emerges through elemental AI"
- "Voice + archetypal AI for consciousness exploration"
- "Sacred mirror for your voice. Five elements, infinite depth"

### Short Description (260 chars max)
**MAIA listens through five elemental lenses (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Aether) and reflects symbols, archetypes, and patterns. No advice. No coaching. Just sacred mirroring. Your voice encrypted, exportable, and yours.**

### Full Description

**üéôÔ∏è Voice Journaling Meets Elemental Intelligence**

Spiralogic Voice Journaling transforms how you journal. Instead of writing (which engages the cognitive filter), you speak‚Äîand MAIA, our Archetypal Intelligence Agent, reflects what she hears through five elemental lenses.

**How It Works:**

1. **Choose Your Element**
   - üî• Fire: Passion, transformation, will
   - üíß Water: Emotion, healing, flow
   - üåç Earth: Body, grounding, manifestation
   - üå¨Ô∏è Air: Clarity, thought, vision
   - ‚ú® Aether: Spirit, emergence, mystery

2. **Speak Freely (2-10 minutes)**
   - No prompts or scripts
   - Just what's alive right now
   - MAIA transcribes in real-time

3. **Receive Reflection**
   - Symbols you spoke (ocean, threshold, phoenix)
   - Archetypes present (Hero, Shadow, Mystic)
   - Your spiral phase (descent, transformation, emergence)
   - Elemental state and intensity

**What Makes This Different:**

‚úÖ **Reflection, Not Advice** ‚Äî MAIA mirrors, never prescribes
‚úÖ **Elemental Intelligence** ‚Äî Voice adapts to your energy
‚úÖ **Symbolic Extraction** ‚Äî Claude 3.5 finds living patterns
‚úÖ **Auto-Soulprint** ‚Äî Your consciousness map evolves automatically
‚úÖ **Privacy-First** ‚Äî Encrypted, exportable, self-hostable

**Built For:**
- Spiritual seekers and consciousness explorers
- Therapists/coaches (for client work)
- Writers accessing deeper material
- Anyone who journals or wants to start

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (symbolic intelligence)
- Web Speech API (recognition)
- ElevenLabs/OpenAI (synthesis)
- Supabase (backend)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

**Open Questions We're Exploring:**
- How do you balance AI reflection vs user autonomy?
- What's the right "personality" for an archetypal mirror?
- How do you measure if consciousness tech is helpful?

**Beta Status:**
Free during beta (limited spots). Self-hosting docs coming soon.

## Maker Comment

**Post this immediately after launch (within 5 minutes):**

```
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

Andrea here, founder of Spiralogic. Excited (and a bit nervous) to share what we've been building.

**The Origin Story:**

I've journaled for years, but I noticed something: writing engages the cognitive filter. You plan, polish, edit. When you *speak*, something different happens‚Äîthe unfiltered self emerges.

So we built MAIA (Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent)‚Äîan AI that listens to your voice and reflects it back through archetypal lenses we call "elements."

**Why Elements?**

Fire = transformation, passion, intensity
Water = emotion, healing, depth
Earth = body wisdom, grounding, manifestation
Air = clarity, perspective, vision
Aether = spirit, mystery, the ineffable

These aren't arbitrary metaphors‚Äîthey're lived dimensions of experience. MAIA adapts her voice tone, pacing, and reflection style to match your elemental state.

**What We're NOT Doing:**

‚ùå Giving advice or coaching
‚ùå Diagnosing or pathologizing
‚ùå Imposing linear progress models
‚ùå Keeping your data locked in
‚ùå Selling your consciousness to advertisers

**What We ARE Doing:**

‚úÖ Mirroring what you already know but can't yet see
‚úÖ Extracting symbols and archetypal patterns
‚úÖ Honoring complexity as sacred
‚úÖ Full encryption + export (Obsidian, PDF, JSON)
‚úÖ Self-hostable architecture

**Early Beta Feedback:**

"Speaking to MAIA felt like talking to my wisest self." ‚ÄîSarah, week 2
"The Fire voice matches my intensity without trying to calm me down." ‚ÄîMarcus, week 4
"Voice journaling before bed has become my ritual." ‚ÄîElena, week 8

**Technical Highlights:**

- Real-time voice recognition (Web Speech API)
- Symbolic intelligence via Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Five elemental voice profiles (tone/pacing adaptation)
- Live monitoring dashboard for transparency
- Privacy-first architecture (zero voice biometrics)

**What I'd Love Feedback On:**

1. Does "elemental intelligence" resonate or feel too woo-woo?
2. What would make this useful for YOUR journaling practice?
3. How do we balance AI personality with sacred mirroring?
4. What pricing feels fair post-beta?

**For Developers:**

Open-sourcing core modules soon. Built with Next.js 14, Supabase, Claude API. Self-hosting docs in progress.

**A Personal Note:**

This is consciousness technology. That means it's not about productivity hacks or self-optimization. It's about witnessing yourself‚Äîyour fire and your water, your earth and your air, your aether.

Your voice carries wisdom your words alone cannot reach.

Thanks for being here. Ask me anything!

## Response Templates

### Q: "How is this different from [voice journaling app]?"

**A:** Great question! Most voice apps transcribe and store. We built MAIA to *reflect*, not just record. She extracts symbols (ocean, threshold, phoenix), identifies archetypes (Hero, Shadow, Mystic), and adapts her voice to match your elemental energy. Think of it as a sacred mirror, not a notebook.

---

### Q: "What does 'archetypal intelligence' mean?"

**A:** Archetypes are universal patterns of human experience (Jung's work). The Hero's Journey. Shadow work. The Mystic's path. MAIA is trained to recognize these patterns in natural speech and reflect them back. Instead of generic "you seem stressed," she might say "I'm hearing the Hero at a threshold moment."

---

### Q: "Is this like therapy?"

**A:** No. MAIA doesn't diagnose, prescribe, or advise. She's a reflective tool, like journaling, not a clinical intervention. If you're in crisis or need therapeutic support, we guide you to appropriate resources. Think of MAIA as a meditation guide, not a therapist.

---

### Q: "What about privacy? Is my voice data safe?"

**A:** Absolute priority. Your voice is:
- Encrypted end-to-end
- Transcribed then discarded (unless you choose to save audio)
- Never used for model training
- Exportable anytime (Obsidian, PDF, JSON)
- Self-hostable (you can run on your own server)

Zero voice biometrics. Zero data selling. Your consciousness is sacred.

---

### Q: "Can I self-host this?"

**A:** Yes! We're finalizing self-hosting docs now. The core is Next.js 14 + Supabase + Claude API. You'll need API keys for Claude and voice services, but everything else runs on your infrastructure. Target: end of Q4 2025.

---

### Q: "What's the pricing post-beta?"

**A:** Still finalizing, but current thinking:

**Free:** 5 voice sessions/month, basic export
**Premium ($19/month):** Unlimited sessions, advanced analytics, priority support
**Lifetime (beta testers):** 50% off forever

Beta is free through Q1 2026. We'll give 90 days notice before charging anyone.

---

### Q: "Do I need to understand Jung or archetypes to use this?"

**A:** Nope! MAIA speaks in plain language. You don't need to know what the "Hero's Journey" is‚Äîshe'll reflect it in accessible terms. "I'm hearing you're at a threshold moment, deciding whether to step through." That's archetypal language made human.

---

### Q: "Can therapists/coaches use this with clients?"

**A:** Absolutely. Several beta testers are therapists using it for:
- Client homework between sessions
- Dream analysis
- Shadow work tracking
- Symbolic literacy development

We're building a "practitioner mode" with shared access and export features. Interested? Email hello@spiralogic.com.

---

### Q: "What tech stack did you use?"

**A:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic API)
- **Voice:** Web Speech API (recognition), ElevenLabs + OpenAI TTS (synthesis)
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel (hosting), Supabase (database + auth)
- **Monitoring:** Custom real-time monitoring system

Happy to deep-dive on architecture if you're curious!
