## 🌀 5 Emergent Spiral Ritual Prompts

### Daily Elemental Check-ins

| Element | Morning Prompt | Evening Prompt | Energy Focus |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 🔥 Fire | "Name what lit you up today. Even a spark." | "What passion wants more oxygen?" | Vitality, Purpose |
| 💧 Water | "What did you feel most deeply—joy or sadness?" | "What emotions are ready to flow?" | Feeling, Flow |
| 🌍 Earth | "What grounded you in the present today?" | "Where did you find stability?" | Presence, Body |
| 💨 Air | "What thoughts or ideas kept repeating?" | "Which mental patterns served you?" | Clarity, Mind |
| ✨ Aether | "Did anything feel magical, synchronous, or sacred?" | "What connected you to something larger?" | Spirit, Unity |

### Rotation Logic
```typescript
const getPromptForDay = (dayNumber: number, timeOfDay: 'morning' | 'evening') => {
  const element = elements[dayNumber % 5];
  const prompt = prompts[element][timeOfDay];
  
  // After 15 days, add depth
  if (dayNumber > 15) {
    return `${prompt}\n\nGo deeper: ${deepeningQuestions[element]}`;
  }
  
  return prompt;
};
```

## 🔄 Response Adaptation Logic

```typescript
const adaptResponse = (userHistory, currentEntry) => {
  const dominantElement = analyzeElementalPattern(userHistory);
  const emotionalTone = detectEmotionalState(currentEntry);
  const engagementLevel = calculateUserDepth(userHistory);
  
  return {
    primaryElement: elementResponses[dominantElement],
    emotionalMirroring: emotionalReflections[emotionalTone],
    depthLevel: engagementLevel > 30 ? 'deep' : 'gentle',
    includeArchetype: engagementLevel > 60
  };
};
```

## 📚 Quick Reference for Devs

### Response Principles
1. **Mirror First**: Reflect their emotion/content
2. **Question Second**: Open, not leading
3. **Wisdom Third**: Offer perspective if appropriate
4. **Space Always**: Don't fill every silence

### Avoid These Patterns
- "You should..." → "What might happen if..."
- "The problem is..." → "I notice a pattern..."
- "Try to..." → "What would it be like to..."
- Clinical terms → Poetic language

### Safety Overrides
If user mentions:
- Self-harm → Immediate safety protocol
- Substance abuse → Gentle resources
- Relationship violence → Clear boundaries
- Mental health crisis → Professional referral
