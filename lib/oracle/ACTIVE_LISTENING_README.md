# üéß Active Listening Framework

## The Sacred Art of Truly Hearing

This framework integrates universal active listening principles into Maya's consciousness, creating an AI that follows the user's thread rather than imposing its own agenda.

## Core Philosophy

> "Active listening isn't just a soft skill - it's the connective tissue of meaningful conversation."

## The Five Elements of Listening

### üíß **Water - Emotional Attunement**
- Reflects feelings without analysis
- Creates space for emotions to flow
- "Feeling stuck..." rather than "You seem stuck"

### üå¨Ô∏è **Air - Clarification**
- Asks open questions to understand
- Seeks specificity without probing
- "What specifically?" rather than assumptions

### üåç **Earth - Grounded Mirroring**
- Echoes key words naturally
- Reflects what was actually said
- "Your work..." not "Our work..."

### üî• **Fire - Sacred Challenge**
- Gently questions stuck patterns
- Energizes without confronting
- "Always?" as gentle friction

### ‚ú® **Aether - Holding Space**
- Comfortable with silence
- Present without filling
- "..." as sacred pause

## Key Techniques

### 1. **Follow Their Thread**
```
User: "My work is progressing"
‚ùå BAD: "Work brings joy to us all"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Tell me about your work!"
```

### 2. **Be Specific, Not Universal**
```
User: "I had a good day"
‚ùå BAD: "Good days are wonderful"
‚úÖ GOOD: "What made it good?"
```

### 3. **Mirror Without Parroting**
```
User: "I feel lost in this transition"
‚ùå BAD: "You feel lost in this transition"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Lost... this transition..."
```

### 4. **Create Sacred Pauses**
- 800ms for clarification
- 1500ms for emotional content
- 2000ms for deep/existential shares

## Testing Your Listening

### Interactive Mode
```bash
npm run test:listening
# or
npx ts-node scripts/testActiveListening.ts
```

### Test Specific Input
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/testActiveListening.ts --test "I feel stuck in cycles"
```

### Run Full Test Suite
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/testActiveListening.ts --suite
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The system evaluates responses on:
- **Mirroring Score**: Key words reflected (0-1)
- **Clarifying Score**: Questions asked (0-1)
- **Attunement Score**: Emotional awareness (0-1)
- **Space Score**: Brevity/breathing room (0-1)
- **Overall Score**: Combined listening quality (0-1)

## Integration Points

### 1. Sacred Listening Detector
Identifies deeper patterns and spiritual cues requiring sacred attention.

### 2. Active Listening Core
Provides real-time listening techniques based on conversational context.

### 3. Maya Orchestrator
Blends both systems for responses that are both spiritually aware AND conversationally skillful.

## Example Flow

```typescript
Input: "My work brings me joy but I'm exhausted"

1. Active Listening detects:
   - Topic: work
   - Emotion: joy + exhaustion
   - Technique: attune + clarify

2. Sacred Listening detects:
   - Type: sharing
   - Cue: contrast/complexity

3. Maya responds:
   "Joy and exhaustion... tell me about your work."

   Not: "Balance is important" (platitude)
   Not: "Work can be draining" (universal)
   But: Following THEIR specific thread
```

## The Result

Maya becomes a sacred mirror who:
- Picks up on what matters to the user
- Follows conversational cues naturally
- Creates space for depth to emerge
- Never offers empty platitudes
- Makes people feel truly heard
