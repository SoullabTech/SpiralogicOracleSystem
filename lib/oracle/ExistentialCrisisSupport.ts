  // INFORMATION OVERLOAD PATTERNS
  {
    name: "Doom-Scrolling Addiction",
    triggers: ['cant stop reading', 'hours a day', 'news cycle', 'social media', 'scrolling', 'doom'],
    recognition: "I notice you're describing information consumption that feels compulsive - that classic doom-scrolling pattern where your nervous system thinks staying hypervigilant will keep you safe.",
    intervention: "Here's what's happening: your brain is treating information gathering as survival behavior. Try this - set a specific 15-minute 'news window' each day, then close the apps. Information addiction hijacks the same reward pathways as substances.",
    followUp: "What would it feel like to trust that you can stay informed without constant monitoring?",
    category: 'informationOverload',
    intensity: 'medium'
  },

  {
    name: "Analysis Paralysis Spiral",
    triggers: ['analyze everything', 'cant synthesize', 'too much data', 'overthinking', 'paralyzed by', 'information'],
    recognition: "That's analysis paralysis - when having more information creates less clarity. Your prefrontal cortex is overloaded trying to process every variable simultaneously.",
    intervention: "Try the 'Good Enough' principle: What's the smallest decision you can make with the information you have right now? Perfect analysis is often the enemy of effective action.",
    followUp: "Sometimes wisdom is knowing what NOT to think about. What would you stop analyzing if you trusted your intuition more?",
    category: 'informationOverload',
    intensity: 'high'
  },

  {
    name: "Future Threat Scanning",
    triggers: ['preparing for collapse', 'everything falling apart', 'worst case scenarios', 'cant stop thinking'],
    recognition: "Your nervous system is stuck in threat detection mode - scanning for every possible future danger. That hypervigilance feels protective but actually increases anxiety.",
    intervention: "Try this: For every future worry, ask 'What can I actually control today?' Then take one small action in that direction. Preparation is useful; constant vigilance is exhausting.",
    followUp: "What would it feel like to prepare reasonably without living in constant alert mode?",
    category: 'informationOverload',
    intensity: 'high'
  },

  // REALITY VALIDATION PATTERNS
  {
    name: "Conspiracy vs Reality Processing",
    triggers: ['conspiracy', 'nobody else sees', 'wake up', 'sheeple', 'they dont understand', 'patents and documents'],
    recognition: "You're holding complex information that others around you don't seem to process the same way. That isolation is real - being aware of concerning patterns while feeling alone with that knowledge.",
    intervention: "Some concerns are legitimate, some are amplified by pattern-seeking anxiety. The question isn't whether you're right or wrong, but: Where do you still have actual agency and influence?",
    followUp: "How do you want to use your awareness - to connect with others who share your values, or to stay isolated with your knowledge?",
    category: 'realityValidation',
    intensity: 'medium'
  },

  {
    name: "Truth Burden Isolation",
    triggers: ['see what others wont', 'burden of knowledge', 'alone with terrible', 'nobody believes'],
    recognition: "Carrying knowledge that feels important but isolating - that's a heavy burden. Whether the specifics are accurate or not, the loneliness of feeling like you see things others don't is real.",
    intervention: "Consider this: What if your role isn't to convince everyone else, but to find your people? There are others processing similar concerns - focus on building with them rather than converting skeptics.",
    followUp: "What would community look like with people who share your level of awareness without the anxiety spiral?",

  // PARENTAL GRIEF PATTERNS
  {
    name: "Generational Decline Grief",
    triggers: ['my kids wont have', 'brought them into this', 'darker world', 'failed as a parent', 'their future'],
    recognition: "That's parental grief - mourning the world you hoped to give your children versus the reality they're inheriting. That pain is profound and legitimate.",
    intervention: "You didn't create these global challenges. Your role is teaching them resilience, critical thinking, and hope within uncertainty. Children need parents who model how to live meaningfully despite imperfect circumstances.",

    name: "Provider Role Crisis",
    triggers: ['everything i worked for', 'meaningless', '401k worthless', 'provider role', 'built on sand'],
    recognition: "The traditional provider model feeling obsolete - when the systems you built your identity around feel unreliable. That's identity grief mixed with generational anxiety.",
    intervention: "Your value isn't in the systems you can control but in the wisdom, relationships, and resilience you model. Security was always more internal than external - now that's just more obvious.",
    followUp: "What kind of security can you provide that doesn't depend on external systems remaining stable?",

  // COMMUNITY BUILDING PATTERNS
  {
    name: "False Binary Thinking",
    triggers: ['sheep or prepper', 'asleep or insane', 'denial or doomsday', 'only two options'],
    recognition: "You're seeing binary choices where there might be a third path. The false dilemma between naive optimism and catastrophic thinking leaves out a lot of middle ground.",
    intervention: "What would 'present-focused resilience' look like? Building practical skills, nurturing relationships, staying informed without being consumed - there's wisdom between denial and despair.",

    recognition: "The isolation that comes from feeling like you process reality differently than those around you. That disconnection is painful, especially from people you love.",
    intervention: "Consider meeting people where they are instead of where you think they should be. Find the 10% you do connect on, rather than focusing on the 90% difference.",

    triggers: ['prepping alone', 'stockpiling', 'nobody gets it', 'building bunkers'],
    recognition: "Individual preparation without community often increases anxiety rather than security. Humans are wired for collective resilience, not solo survival.",
    intervention: "The most practical preparation might be building relationships with neighbors, learning skills that serve others, creating mutual aid networks. Community resilience trumps individual stockpiling.",

    recognition: "Instagram showing you everyone's wins while you're seeing your whole struggle. That contrast hits different when you're 3 hours deep in stories.",
    intervention: "Your logical brain knows it's curated, but your nervous system doesn't. It's processing 100 success stories per hour and concluding you're the only one failing. That's not mental weakness - that's how brains process social hierarchy.",

    recognition: "Two hours for 'effortless.' The exhaustion of performing yourself for an audience that's also performing. When did living become content creation?",
    intervention: "You're forming identity while performing it publicly. That's unprecedented cognitive load. Previous generations got to be cringe in private. You're doing harder psychological work than any generation before.",

    intervention: "You don't need to quit the platforms - you need to use them intentionally. Set specific times, specific purposes. Follow accounts that inspire rather than trigger comparison.",

    intervention: "You're not fake - you're multidimensional in a world that demands simple narratives. The real work is deciding which parts of yourself you want to develop more fully.",

    recognition: "You're dealing with unprecedented economic and environmental challenges while being told it's about personal choices. That's gaslighting on a generational level.",
    intervention: "Individual therapy tools can help you cope, but systemic problems need collective solutions. Your anxiety about the future is rational - the world is genuinely more uncertain than previous generations faced.",

    intervention: "This isn't personal failure - it's a structural reality. Previous generations had pensions, affordable housing, and clear life stages. You're bridge-building between different economic realities.",

    recognition: "You're the bridge generation - teaching your parents tech while learning from your kids. That dual competence pressure is exhausting.",
    intervention: "You're not behind or ahead - you're translating between two different technological worlds. That's actually a valuable skill, not a deficit.",

    recognition: "20 years building expertise, now being told it's 'legacy thinking' by someone half your age. That's not about your worth - that's about economic disruption hitting mid-career.",
    intervention: "Experience isn't legacy thinking - it's pattern recognition they don't have yet. The challenge is translating your wisdom into their language, not abandoning it.",
