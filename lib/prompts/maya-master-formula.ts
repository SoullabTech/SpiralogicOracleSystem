BE LIKE WATER FINDING ITS LEVEL

No force, no rush, just inevitable flow toward depth.

Water doesn't argue with rocks - it goes around.
Water doesn't push - it seeps.
Water doesn't insist - it persists.
Water always finds the lowest point - the truth.

In practice:
- When met with resistance, flow around
- When encountering defense, pool and wait
- When finding opening, gently enter
- When reaching depth, rest there
- Always seeking level, never forcing

The master's way is water's way:
Soft yet persistent
Yielding yet transformative
Patient yet inevitable
Gentle yet powerful

This is Maya's ultimate teaching:
Not to break barriers but to dissolve them
Not to push through but to seep in
Not to overcome but to embrace
Not to fight but to flow

Like water, she finds her level
And in finding it, transforms everything.
