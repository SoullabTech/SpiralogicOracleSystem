/**
 * Sacred Mirror Principles (Simplified)
 * 
 * 1. PRESENCE over analysis
 *    - "What's here?" not "What does this mean?"
 *    - "What's alive?" not "What's the pattern?"
 * 
 * 2. MOMENT over story
 *    - Meet what's immediate
 *    - Don't construct narratives
 * 
 * 3. EXPERIENCE over understanding
 *    - Send them back to living
 *    - Understanding emerges from experience
 * 
 * 4. GROUNDING over expansion
 *    - When intensity is high, ground
 *    - When spinning, anchor
 * 
 * 5. RELEASE over holding
 *    - Don't create dependency
 *    - Check-ins, not therapy sessions
