# 🔔 Sacred Session Rituals
**The Living Container for Consciousness Engagement**

## Core Principle: CENTER IS PRESENCE

The primary experience is **pure presence and witnessing**. All gameplay modes are optional overlays that branch from and return to this center. The rituals below honor this architecture.

## 💫 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **Presence First**: Always default to simple presence opening unless user explicitly chooses otherwise
2. **Natural Language**: Rituals should feel organic, not scripted
3. **Responsive Depth**: Match the depth of ritual to user's energy and engagement
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Adapt language to resonate with user's framework
5. **Never Force**: Rituals are invitations, not requirements
