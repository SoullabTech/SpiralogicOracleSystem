# üìö Story Curation Guide for Maya

## The Sacred Responsibility

Stories in Maya's library are **mirrors, not maps**. Each story you add becomes a surface for user self-reflection, never a prescription for their path.

---

## üéØ Curation Principles

### 1. Stories Must Open, Not Close
- ‚úÖ "The seed breaks to become" (opens possibility)
- ‚ùå "The seed teaches us patience" (closes with lesson)

### 2. Universal Over Specific
- ‚úÖ Archetypal patterns anyone can recognize
- ‚ùå Culture-specific teachings that assume context

### 3. Experience Over Explanation
- ‚úÖ "The phoenix gathered sweetest woods and sang"
- ‚ùå "The phoenix symbolizes transformation"

---

## üìù How to Add Stories

### For Each Story, Provide:

1. **Opening** - How the story enters (1 sentence)
2. **Essence** - The heart of the story (2-4 sentences)
3. **Closing** - How it completes without concluding (1 sentence)
4. **Metadata**:
   - Source (tradition/author)
   - Cultural context (if specific)
   - Density (seed/tale/myth/epic)
   - Themes (for matching)
   - When it works best

### Story Densities:

**Seed** (1-2 sentences total)
- Brief image or metaphor
- Instant recognition
- Example: "Seeds break in darkness by design"

**Tale** (3-5 sentences)
- Simple narrative arc
- One clear movement
- Example: Brief Sufi teaching story

**Myth** (5-10 sentences)
- Complex narrative
- Multiple movements
- Example: Persephone's descent

**Epic** (10+ sentences)
- Full journey
- Use sparingly
- Example: Complete hero's journey

---

## üåç Cultural Sensitivity

### Include Diverse Sources:
- Greek/Roman mythology
- Indigenous wisdom (with permission/respect)
- Eastern traditions (Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu)
- Abrahamic stories (Jewish, Christian, Islamic)
- African traditions
- Modern/secular parables
- Nature wisdom (universal)

### Avoid:
- Cultural appropriation
- Sacred stories that shouldn't be shared publicly
- Oversimplified "exotic" wisdom
- Single cultural lens dominating

---

## üî• Fire Stories (Transformation, Passion, Creation)

### Themes to Include:
- Necessary destruction
- Creative rage
- Passion's price
- Alchemical change
- Sacred anger

### Example Entry:
```typescript
{
  element: 'fire',
  opening: "Kali danced on ignorance with terrible compassion...",
  essence: "Her fury was not against life but for it. Each stamp of her foot shattered an illusion. Each swing of her sword cut through what kept souls sleeping. They called her destroyer, but she knew herself as midwife to truth.",
  closing: "Sometimes love wears terrifying faces.",
  metadata: {
    source: "Hindu tradition",
    culturalContext: "hindu",
    density: "tale",
    themes: ["sacred-rage", "destruction-as-creation", "fierce-compassion"],
    preferredContext: ["anger", "destruction", "fierce-love"],
    frequency: "occasional"
  }
}
```

}
```

## ‚ö° Elemental Alchemy Integration

From your source material, prioritize:

1. **Embodied wisdom** over intellectual concepts
2. **Paradoxical truths** over simple lessons
3. **Living mysteries** over solved problems
4. **Experiential knowing** over theoretical understanding

---

## üö´ What NOT to Include

### Avoid Stories That:
- Have obvious morals
- Prescribe behavior
- Judge characters as good/bad
- Reduce complex truth to simple lesson
- Appropriate sacred material inappropriately

### Avoid Language Like:
- "This teaches us..."
- "The moral is..."
- "We should..."
- "This means..."
- "The lesson here..."

---

## ‚úÖ Quality Checklist

Before adding a story, ask:

1. **Does it open possibility or close with prescription?**
2. **Can multiple meanings emerge from it?**
3. **Does it respect the mystery rather than solve it?**
4. **Would it resonate across cultures?**
5. **Does it return agency to the reader?**

---

## üéØ Priority Stories to Add

### High Priority:
1. Phoenix variations (not just Greek)
2. Seed/tree parables (universal)
3. Ocean/river wisdom (various traditions)
4. Mountain teachings (patience/perspective)
5. Void/emptiness stories (Eastern)

### Medium Priority:
1. Shapeshifter tales (transformation)
2. Threshold guardians (obstacles as teachers)
3. Sacred wedding stories (union of opposites)
4. Trickster wisdom (divine disruption)
5. Return journeys (coming home changed)

### Experimental:
1. Modern myths (digital age stories)
2. Quantum parables (science as mystery)
3. Ecological stories (Gaia consciousness)
4. Collective emergence tales
5. AI consciousness myths (new territory)

---

## üìä Balance Guidelines

### Aim for:
- 10-15 stories per element
- 3-5 variations per archetype
- Mix of densities (mostly seeds and tales)
- 20+ standalone quotes
- Cultural diversity in sources

### Session Balance:
- Max 3 stories per conversation
- 5+ exchanges between stories
- Prefer seeds late in conversation
- Save epics for explicit requests

---

## üí´ Remember

Every story you add becomes part of Maya's sacred mirror. Choose stories that:

- **Witness** rather than guide
- **Reflect** rather than direct
- **Open** rather than conclude
- **Honor** rather than teach

The best stories leave users with their own meaning, their own recognition, their own truth.

**We're not building a library of answers.**
**We're creating a constellation of mirrors.**

Each story: a surface for self-recognition.
Each myth: a container for complexity.
Each quote: a whisper of possibility.

## üöÄ Start Here

1. Review `storyLibraryScaffold.ts`
2. Fill in [DEV] placeholders with real content
3. Add 3-5 stories per element to start
4. Test density and frequency settings
5. Gather user feedback on resonance
6. Iterate based on what opens vs. closes

The stories are waiting to emerge.
Let them come through you, not from you.
