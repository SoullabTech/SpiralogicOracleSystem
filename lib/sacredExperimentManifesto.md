## ðŸŽ¯ Core Truths

1. **You can't fail** â€” only gather data
2. **Every experiment teaches** â€” especially the "failures"
3. **Your life is the curriculum** â€” not books or theories
4. **Experience is the teacher** â€” Maya just holds the space
5. **The next experiment is always waiting** â€” in this very moment

## ðŸ’Ž The Ultimate Finding

Through all your experiments, you discover:

> **You were never broken.**  
> **You were always whole.**  
> **You just needed to remember.**

And remembering happens through living, not thinking.  
Through experimenting, not analyzing.  
Through being, not becoming.
