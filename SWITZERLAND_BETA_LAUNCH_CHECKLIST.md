## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Quick Reference**

### **Common Launch Day Issues**

**High TTS Latency (>60 seconds)**:
- ✅ **Expected behavior** - frame as "Maya's conscious processing"
- 🛠️ **If excessive**: Check ElevenLabs API status, verify fallback chain
- 📢 **User message**: "Maya is processing deeply - her thoughtful responses are worth the wait"

**Memory Not Persisting**:
- 🔍 **Check**: Supabase connection, session table writes
- 🛠️ **Fix**: Verify environment variables, database permissions
- 📢 **User message**: "We're ensuring Maya remembers you perfectly - please try again"

**Voice Interface Not Loading**:
- 🔍 **Check**: WebGL support, browser compatibility
- 🛠️ **Fix**: Provide CSS fallback instructions
- 📢 **User message**: "Try refreshing or switching to Chrome/Firefox for the full experience"

**Dashboard Metrics Stale**:
- 🔍 **Check**: API endpoints responding, database connectivity
- 🛠️ **Fix**: Restart services, verify mock data fallback
- 📢 **Internal**: Switch to manual monitoring until resolved
