## Response Templates

### Common Question: "How is this different from [other app]?"

**Response**:
> Great question! Most voice apps transcribe and store. MAIA reflects and evolves. She extracts symbols (ocean, threshold, phoenix), identifies archetypes (Hero, Shadow, Mystic), and adapts her voice to your elemental energy. Think of it as a sacred mirror, not a notebook.

---

### Common Question: "What about privacy?"

**Response**:
> Absolute priority. Your voice is encrypted end-to-end, transcribed then discarded (unless you choose to save), never used for training, and fully exportable (Obsidian/PDF/JSON). Self-hostable architecture coming soon. Zero voice biometrics. Zero data selling.

---

### Common Question: "Is this like therapy?"

**Response**:
> No. MAIA doesn't diagnose, prescribe, or advise. She's a reflective tool, like journaling, not a clinical intervention. If you're in crisis, we guide you to appropriate resources. Think of MAIA as a meditation guide, not a therapist.

---

### Common Question: "Pricing?"

**Response**:
> Free during beta through Q1 2026. Current thinking post-beta: Free tier (5 sessions/month), Premium ($19/month unlimited), Lifetime discount (50% off for beta testers). We'll give 90 days notice before charging anyone.
