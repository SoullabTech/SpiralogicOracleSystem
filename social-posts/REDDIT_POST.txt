TITLE: I built a voice journaling app with elemental AI that reflects, not advises [beta launch]

BODY:

Hey everyone,

I've been building Spiralogic for the past year and we just launched voice journaling with something I'm calling "elemental intelligence."

**The problem I was trying to solve:**

Writing is powerful, but it engages the cognitive filter. You edit, polish, plan. When you *speak*, something different happens‚Äîthe unfiltered self emerges.

But most voice apps just transcribe and store. I wanted something that could *reflect* what you're saying, not give advice or coach you.

**What I built:**

MAIA (Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent) listens to your voice and interprets it through five elemental lenses:

- üî• **Fire**: When you're processing transformation, passion, intensity
- üíß **Water**: When you're in emotion, grief, healing
- üåç **Earth**: When you need grounding, body wisdom, stability
- üå¨Ô∏è **Air**: When you're seeking clarity, perspective, vision
- ‚ú® **Aether**: When you're touching spirit, mystery, the ineffable

She reflects back:
- Symbols you spoke (ocean, threshold, phoenix)
- Archetypes present (Hero, Shadow, Mystic)
- Your "spiral phase" (descent, transformation, emergence)
- Elemental state and intensity

**Early beta feedback:**

"Speaking to MAIA felt like talking to my wisest self."
"The Fire voice matches my intensity without trying to calm me down."
"Voice journaling before bed has become my ritual."

**Privacy stuff:**
- Voice is encrypted
- No biometrics or voiceprints
- Full export to Obsidian/PDF
- Self-hostable (open source coming soon)

**Would love feedback from this community:**
- What resonates?
- What feels off?
- What would make this useful for your practice?

Free during beta. Link in profile.

Thanks for reading!
