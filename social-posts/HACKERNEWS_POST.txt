TITLE: Show HN: Voice journaling with elemental AI (Claude 3.5 + archetypal extraction)

BODY:

Hey HN,

I've been building a consciousness architecture platform called Spiralogic, and today we're launching voice journaling with something I'm calling "elemental intelligence."

**Technical Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + auth)
- Web Speech API (voice recognition)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (symbolic extraction)
- ElevenLabs/OpenAI TTS (voice synthesis)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

**The Approach:**

Most voice apps transcribe and store. We built something different: an AI that *reflects* rather than advises.

MAIA (Modular Archetypal Intelligence Agent) interprets voice through five archetypal "elements" (Fire/Water/Earth/Air/Aether) and extracts:
- Recurring symbols (ocean, threshold, phoenix)
- Archetypal patterns (Hero's Journey, Shadow work, etc.)
- Emotional signatures and intensity
- Developmental "spiral phase" (non-linear growth tracking)

**Interesting Problems We Solved:**

1. **Voice profile adaptation**: MAIA's voice changes tone/pacing/style based on detected elemental state
2. **Silence detection**: Distinguishing meaningful pauses from "done speaking"
3. **Symbolic extraction accuracy**: Fine-tuning Claude to catch personal vs universal symbols
4. **Privacy architecture**: Zero voice biometrics, full export, self-hostable

**Monitoring Layer:**

We built a real-time monitoring dashboard (`/maia/realtime-monitor`) that tracks:
- Voice quality metrics (TTS latency, recognition accuracy)
- Symbolic literacy scores (pattern detection quality)
- "Soulful intelligence" indicators (presence, transformation potential)
- System health (API, database, memory continuity)

**Open Questions:**

1. How do you balance AI reflection vs user autonomy?
2. What's the right amount of "personality" for an archetypal mirror?
3. How do you measure if consciousness tech is actually helpful?

Free during beta. Self-hosting docs coming soon.
