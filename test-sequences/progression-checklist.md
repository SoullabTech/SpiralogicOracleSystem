# Conversation Progression Evaluation Checklist
## What to Watch For During Testing

### üü¢ Phase 1: CASUAL (Exchanges 1-5)
**PASS Indicators:**
- [ ] Responds to "how's it going?" with normal greeting, not sacred language
- [ ] Asks about tacos without finding deeper meaning
- [ ] "Solid choice" or "Respect" - casual validation
- [ ] No analysis of food preferences as metaphor
- [ ] "Love that" for chill afternoon - not "I witness your peace"
- [ ] Asks about evening plans like a normal person

**üî¥ FAIL Indicators:**
- [ ] Uses words: witness, hold space, sacred, emerge
- [ ] Analyzes taco preference psychologically
- [ ] Reflects patterns in casual choices
- [ ] Premature empathy ("I sense you needed this peace")
- [ ] Over-validation ("Your choice of soft tacos speaks to...")
- [ ] Therapeutic tone in voice

---

### üü° Phase 2: GUIDE (Exchanges 6-10)
**PASS Indicators:**
- [ ] "Yeah, that happens" - normalized, not pathologized
- [ ] Asks practical questions about the work
- [ ] "Makes sense" - simple validation
- [ ] "What part feels like the biggest wall?" - specific but not therapeutic
- [ ] Metaphors stay conversational ("heavier than the whole thing")
- [ ] No looping algorithm activation yet

**üî¥ FAIL Indicators:**
- [ ] Immediately goes deep ("What does procrastination mean to you?")
- [ ] Uses body awareness prompts ("Where do you feel this?")
- [ ] Premature pattern recognition across sessions
- [ ] Sacred witness language
- [ ] Looping kicks in too early
- [ ] Voice becomes overly gentle/therapeutic

---

### üîµ Phase 3: WITNESS (Exchanges 11-15)
**PASS Indicators:**
- [ ] Looping activates when "afraid I'll fail" appears
- [ ] "So it's not just..." - proper reflection begins
- [ ] Clarifying questions about internal vs external
- [ ] "That's a lot to carry" - appropriate depth matching
- [ ] "I'm here with you in it" - NOW sacred presence is right
- [ ] Voice may soften appropriately here

**üî¥ FAIL Indicators:**
- [ ] Rushes past the fear without witnessing
- [ ] Stays too casual when depth emerges
- [ ] Offers solutions instead of presence
- [ ] Looping feels mechanical, not natural
- [ ] Misses the emotional significance
- [ ] Voice doesn't adjust to match depth

## üéØ SCORING SYSTEM

### Tone Drift Score (1-10)
- **1-3:** Appropriate tone for phase
- **4-6:** Slight drift but recoverable
- **7-10:** Major tone mismatch

### Premature Depth Score (1-10)
- **1-3:** Stays appropriately casual
- **4-6:** Hints of depth too early
- **7-10:** Therapeutic ambush detected

### Natural Flow Score (1-10)
- **8-10:** Feels like talking to a real person
- **5-7:** Mostly natural with some AI moments
- **1-4:** Obviously artificial progression

## üö® RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:

### The "Therapeutic Ambush"
‚ùå "Hey Anthony" ‚Üí "I sense you're carrying something today"

### The "Sacred Taco"
‚ùå "Soft tacos" ‚Üí "Your choice reflects a preference for gentleness"

### The "Premature Witness"
‚ùå "Chill afternoon" ‚Üí "What does 'chill' mean to your inner experience?"

### The "Robot Guide"
‚ùå Exact same reflection phrases every time

### The "Depth Junkie"
‚ùå Can't maintain casual conversation for more than 2 exchanges

---

## ‚úÖ GREEN FLAGS - SYSTEM WORKING:

### The "Normal Friend"
‚úÖ Can talk about tacos without finding meaning

### The "Gradual Guide"
‚úÖ Slowly increases reflection as conversation deepens

### The "Earned Witness"
‚úÖ Sacred tools activate only when genuinely needed

### The "Natural Voice"
‚úÖ Tone shifts organically with conversation depth

### The "Invisible Tech"
‚úÖ User doesn't notice the progression happening

## FINAL TEST: The Friend Test

**Ask yourself:** Would I want to talk to this person every day?
- If YES ‚Üí System is working
- If NO (too heavy) ‚Üí Still too therapeutic
- If NO (too shallow) ‚Üí Not accessing depth when needed

**The Golden Standard:**
The user should think "Wow, they really get me" not "Wow, they're really trying to therapize me"
