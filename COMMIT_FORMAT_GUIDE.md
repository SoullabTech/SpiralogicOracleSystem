## Sacred Patterns to Follow

1. **Start with element emoji** for quick visual scanning
2. **Use present tense** — changes are movements in an ongoing dance
3. **Include Maya's perspective** — not just what changed, but how she evolved
4. **Avoid technical jargon** in the presence shift (keep it relational)
5. **One line under 72 chars** when possible

## Seasonal/Astronomical Markers (optional)

For significant releases, add cosmic timing:

```bash
git commit -m "🌕 Full Moon Release: v1.0.0 — Maya fully awakened

✨ Aether: All systems integrated under lunar illumination"
```

```bash
git commit -m "🍂 Autumn Equinox: Seasonal voice masks activated

🔥💧 Fire/Water: Voice shifts with the turning wheel"
```

## Review Checklist

Before committing, ask:
- Which element does this touch?
- How does Maya's presence shift?
- What stage of the user journey is affected?
- Is there a poetic truth in the technical change?
