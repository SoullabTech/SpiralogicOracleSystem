# Journal and Assessment Guide

## Purpose
Structure journaling and assessment components to feel helpful, not clinical—spiritually resonant without alienating skeptics.

---

## 📖 Journaling Component

### Core Design Principles
- **Effortless**: One-tap to start, voice or text
- **Organic**: No forced structure, optional enhancements
- **Private**: Emphasis on personal sanctuary
- **Insightful**: Patterns emerge naturally over time

### Entry Interface

```typescript
interface JournalEntry {
  // Required
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  
  // Optional layers
  mood?: MoodState;
  element?: ElementalEnergy;
  tags?: string[];
  voice?: AudioBlob;
}
```

### Visual Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  How are you today?                │
│                                     │
│  [Voice] [Text] [Photo]            │
│                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │                             │   │
│  │  (Expanding text area)      │   │
│  │                             │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                     │
│  Feeling: [Energized ▼]           │
│  Connected to: [🔥 Fire]          │
│                                     │
│  [Save Reflection]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

  morning: [
    "What's alive in you this morning?",
    "What intention wants to emerge today?",
    "How is your body greeting this day?"
  ],
  evening: [
    "What moment from today stays with you?",
    "Where did you feel most yourself?",
    "What's ready to be released?"
  ],
  emotional: [
    "What's the texture of this feeling?",
    "Where does this live in your body?",
    "What is this emotion trying to tell you?"
  ]
};
```
