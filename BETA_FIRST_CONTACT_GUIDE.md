**Watch for:**
- Live transcript appearing as you speak

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Expectations**

### **What Works Great:**
- Memory persistence across conversations
- Live voice transcription
- Natural conversation flow
- Context awareness and recall

### **Current Beta Limitations:**
- **Voice Response Delay:** 2-4 seconds is normal (Maya is reflecting)
- **Occasional Transcript Gaps:** Speak clearly, pause between thoughts
- **Memory Loading:** First response might take longer as context loads
- **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome works best, Firefox is okay

### **If Things Go Wrong:**
- **No mic access:** Refresh page, click "Allow" on permissions popup
- **Silent response:** Check volume, wait 5-10 seconds for audio
- **Transcript not appearing:** Speak louder, check mic permissions
- **Maya seems generic:** Ask about your history - memory might be loading

## üé≠ **Getting the Most from Maya**

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Speak naturally** - Don't overthink the "AI voice interface"
2. **Ask about your patterns** - Maya's memory is her superpower
3. **Be philosophical** - Maya excels at deeper conversations
4. **Test her memory** - Reference things from previous chats
5. **Give feedback** - Your input shapes Maya's development

### **Conversation Starters That Work Well:**
- "Maya, I'm curious about..."
- "Help me understand why I keep..."
- "What do you notice about my approach to..."
- "I've been thinking about what you said before about..."
- "Challenge me on..."

### **What Makes Maya Different:**
- She remembers who you are across sessions
- She speaks back (not just text responses)  
- She builds understanding of your patterns over time
- She offers philosophical depth, not just task completion
