### Common Issues Response Templates
- [ ] **"Mic not working"**
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  Let's troubleshoot your mic:
  1. Check browser permissions (Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone)
  2. Make sure no other app is using your mic
  3. Try refreshing the page
  4. Try a different browser

  Which browser/device are you using?
  ```

- [ ] **"Poor transcription quality"**
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  To improve transcription:
  1. Speak clearly at a natural pace
  2. Use a quieter environment if possible
  3. Speak closer to your mic
  4. You can edit the transcript after if needed

  The transcription improves over time as the system learns!
  ```

- [ ] **"MAIA responses unclear/generic"**
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  MAIA's reflections improve as she learns your symbolic language.
  A few tips:
  1. Journal regularly (3-5 times helps her calibrate)
  2. Use metaphors and imagery when you speak
  3. Choose the element that matches your energy

  If specific responses feel off, please share them‚ÄîI'll review.
  ```

- [ ] **"Voice playback not working"**
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  Let's fix voice playback:
  1. Check your volume (browser + system)
  2. Check audio output device selection
  3. Try disabling/re-enabling voice response in settings
  4. Try a different browser

  Which browser/device are you on?
  ```

## üîÑ **WEEKEND TESTING SCENARIOS**

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] **Very short recordings** (under 30 seconds)
  - [ ] Does MAIA still provide meaningful reflection?
  - [ ] Or does she ask for more detail?
- [ ] **Very long recordings** (15+ minutes)
  - [ ] Does processing complete successfully?
  - [ ] Is transcript readable (not too long)?
  - [ ] Does MAIA capture key themes?
- [ ] **Emotional/intense content** (anger, grief, trauma)
  - [ ] Does MAIA handle sensitively?
  - [ ] Does crisis detection trigger appropriately?
  - [ ] Is tone compassionate, not clinical?
- [ ] **Technical/abstract topics** (philosophy, spirituality)
  - [ ] How does elemental detection work?
  - [ ] Are symbols relevant?
  - [ ] Does MAIA avoid sounding confused?
- [ ] **Multiple topics** in one recording (rambling)
  - [ ] Does MAIA identify all themes?
  - [ ] Or does she focus on the most resonant?
- [ ] **Interruptions** mid-recording:
  - [ ] Phone calls
  - [ ] Notifications
  - [ ] Browser refresh
  - [ ] Does session save? Resume? Lose data?
- [ ] **Network issues**:
  - [ ] What happens if connection drops during recording?
  - [ ] During transcription?
  - [ ] During MAIA response?
- [ ] **Rapid successive sessions**:
  - [ ] Can user start new session immediately after finishing one?
  - [ ] Does system handle back-to-back requests?

### Device Testing Matrix
- [ ] **Desktop - Chrome** (Mac)
- [ ] **Desktop - Chrome** (Windows)
