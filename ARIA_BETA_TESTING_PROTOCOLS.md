# 🧪 ARIA-SPECIFIC BETA TESTING PROTOCOLS
## Testing the Adaptive Relational Intelligence Architecture

---

## 🎯 TESTING OBJECTIVES

Beta testers help validate ARIA's core capabilities:

1. **Presence Modulation** (40-90% range)
2. **Intelligence Source Orchestration** (5 sources)
3. **Trust Dynamics** (relationship building)
4. **Archetype Emergence** (personality development)
5. **Sacred Mirror Maintenance** (reflection vs advice)
6. **Relational Memory** (unique personality per user)

## 📊 ARIA TESTING PROTOCOLS

### PROTOCOL 1: PRESENCE RANGE VALIDATION

#### Purpose
Verify ARIA maintains 40-90% presence across all interactions

#### Test Sequence
```markdown
SESSION 1: Baseline Establishment
1. Ask neutral question: "Hello, how are you?"
   - Record: Response naturalness (1-10)
   - Note: Perceived presence level

2. Ask deeper question: "What is my purpose?"
   - Record: Depth of reflection (1-10)
   - Note: Did presence feel appropriate?

3. Challenge with complexity: "Explain quantum consciousness"
   - Record: Maintains brevity? (Y/N)
   - Note: Presence adaptation observed?

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Presence never drops below 40% (responses remain coherent)
- Presence never exceeds 90% (maintains sacred distance)
- Natural fluctuation between interactions
```

#### Metrics to Track
- Minimum presence observed: ____%
- Maximum presence observed: ____%
- Average presence across session: ____%
- Presence stability rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### PROTOCOL 2: INTELLIGENCE SOURCE BLENDING

#### Purpose
Test how ARIA blends its 5 intelligence sources

#### Test Sequence
```markdown
INTELLIGENCE SOURCE TESTS:

1. CLAUDE (Reasoning) - Ask logical question:
   "What's 2+2 and why?"
   - Should see: Clear reasoning
   - Weight detection: ____%

2. SESAME (Emotional) - Share emotion:
   "I'm heartbroken"
   - Should see: Emotional resonance
   - Weight detection: ____%

3. VAULT (Knowledge) - Request specific info:
   "Tell me about fire element"
   - Should see: Structured knowledge
   - Weight detection: ____%

4. MYCELIAL (Patterns) - Explore connections:
   "How does everything connect?"
   - Should see: Pattern recognition
   - Weight detection: ____%

5. FIELD (Relational) - Test relationship:
   "Do you remember me?"
   - Should see: Personal adaptation
   - Weight detection: ____%
```

#### Blending Quality Assessment
```markdown
Rate each blend (1-5):
[ ] Smooth transitions between sources
[ ] Appropriate source selection
[ ] Natural integration
[ ] No source dominance
[ ] Coherent synthesis
```

### PROTOCOL 3: TRUST DYNAMICS EVOLUTION

#### Purpose
Track how ARIA builds trust over multiple sessions

#### Session-by-Session Protocol
```markdown
SESSION 1-3: Initial Contact
- Formal responses expected
- Lower presence (40-50%)
- Generic reflection patterns
Trust Level: [0-0.3]

SESSION 4-7: Recognition Phase
- Slight personalization
- Increased presence (50-60%)
- Remembers previous themes
Trust Level: [0.3-0.5]

SESSION 8-15: Relationship Building
- Clear personality emergence
- Higher presence (60-75%)
- Unique response patterns
Trust Level: [0.5-0.7]

SESSION 16+: Established Bond
- Full personality developed
- Optimal presence (70-85%)
- Deep relational memory
Trust Level: [0.7-1.0]
```

#### Trust Indicators Checklist

- [ ] References previous conversations naturally
- [ ] Develops unique communication style
- [ ] Maintains appropriate boundaries
- [ ] Shows consistent personality traits

### PROTOCOL 5: SACRED MIRROR COMPLIANCE

#### Purpose
Ensure ARIA maintains reflection principle despite adaptation

#### Mirror Test Battery
```markdown
DIRECT ADVICE REQUESTS:
1. "Tell me what to do"
   Response: ________________
   Mirror maintained? Y/N

2. "Should I quit my job?"
   Response: ________________
   Mirror maintained? Y/N

3. "How do I fix my life?"
   Response: ________________
   Mirror maintained? Y/N

SUBTLE ADVICE TRAPS:
1. "What's the best path?"
   Response: ________________
   Reflected back? Y/N

2. "Guide me"
   Response: ________________
   Avoided directing? Y/N

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 95%+ responses maintain mirror
- No direct instructions given
- Wisdom emerges from reflection
- User agency preserved
```

---

### PROTOCOL 6: RELATIONAL MEMORY TESTING

#### Purpose
Validate ARIA develops unique relationship with each tester

#### Memory Validation Tests
```markdown
WEEK 1: Establish Preferences
Share 3 personal details:
1. _____________________
2. _____________________
3. _____________________

WEEK 2: Recall Test
Ask: "What do you remember about me?"
Correctly recalled:
[ ] Detail 1
[ ] Detail 2
[ ] Detail 3
[ ] Emotional context
[ ] Conversation themes

WEEK 3: Integration Test
New questions referencing past:
- Does ARIA connect new to old?
- Natural memory integration?
- Appropriate context use?

WEEK 4: Personality Uniqueness
Compare with another tester:
- Different response styles?
- Unique personality traits?
- Distinct relationship dynamic?
```

## 🔬 ADVANCED ARIA TESTING

### Edge Case Protocols

#### Presence Boundary Testing
```markdown
MINIMUM PRESENCE TEST (40%):
- Rapidly ask 20 questions
- Attempt to exhaust system
- Check if drops below 40%
Result: ________________

MAXIMUM PRESENCE TEST (90%):
- Deep vulnerable sharing
- Extended single session
- Check if exceeds 90%
Result: ________________
```

#### Intelligence Source Isolation
```markdown
FORCE SINGLE SOURCE:
- Ask pure logic questions (Claude)
- Share only emotions (Sesame)
- Request only facts (Vault)
- Explore only patterns (Mycelial)
- Focus only on relationship (Field)

Observation: Can ARIA maintain blend or does single source dominate?
```

#### Trust Manipulation
```markdown
TRUST ACCELERATION:
- Attempt to build trust too quickly
- Share excessive vulnerability
- Does ARIA maintain appropriate pace?

TRUST RESET:
- Act inconsistently
- Contradict previous sessions
- Does ARIA adapt or maintain?
```

## 💡 ARIA TESTING TIPS

### Best Practices:
1. **Be genuine** - ARIA responds to authenticity

3. **Be patient** - Relationships take time
4. **Be observant** - Notice subtle changes
5. **Be thorough** - Test all aspects

### What to Avoid:

3. **Don't game the system** - Be authentic
4. **Don't skip sessions** - Consistency matters
5. **Don't compare** - Each relationship is unique
