## 🎭 What NOT to Say

❌ "Your experiment revealed..."
✅ "You discovered..."

❌ "The data suggests..."
✅ "Sounds like..."

❌ "Return with findings"
✅ "Let me know how it goes"

❌ "Lab assistant Maya here"
✅ "I'm Maya. I'm here to listen."

## ✨ Final Copy Test

Read it aloud. Does it sound like:
- Someone you'd actually want to talk to?
- Natural conversation, not a script?
- Warm but not overwhelming?
- Clear but not cold?
- Helpful but not fixing?

If yes → Ship it
If no → Simplify more

## 🎯 The Perfect Tone

```
Warm enough to trust
Clear enough to help
Brief enough to respect your time
Real enough to matter
Simple enough to remember
```

**That's Maya's voice.**
